              Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon ( 
              C 
              ) on nutrient acquisition – 
              C 
              that could otherwise support growth. However, given that most global terrestrial biosphere models ( 
              TBM 
              s) do not include the 
              C 
              cost of nutrient acquisition, these models fail to represent current and future constraints to the land C sink. Here, we integrated a plant productivity‐optimized nutrient acquisition model – the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen Model – into one of the most widely used 
              TBM 
              s, the Community Land Model. Global plant nitrogen ( 
              N 
              ) uptake is dynamically simulated in the coupled model based on the C costs of N acquisition from mycorrhizal roots, nonmycorrhizal roots, N‐fixing microbes, and retranslocation (from senescing leaves). We find that at the global scale, plants spend 2.4 Pg C yr 
              −1 
              to acquire 1.0 Pg N yr 
              −1 
              , and that the C cost of N acquisition leads to a downregulation of global net primary production ( 
              NPP 
              ) by 13\%. Mycorrhizal uptake represented the dominant pathway by which N is acquired, accounting for {\textasciitilde}66\% of the N uptake by plants. Notably, roots associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal ( 
              AM 
              ) fungi – generally considered for their role in phosphorus (P) acquisition – are estimated to be the primary source of global plant N uptake owing to the dominance of 
              AM 
              ‐associated plants in mid‐ and low‐latitude biomes. Overall, our coupled model improves the representations of 
              NPP 
              downregulation globally and generates spatially explicit patterns of belowground C allocation, soil N uptake, and N retranslocation at the global scale. Such model improvements are critical for predicting how plant responses to altered N availability (owing to N deposition, rising atmospheric 
              CO 
              2 
              , and warming temperatures) may impact the land C sink.},

                  The distribution of Bornean heath forest on white sand soils is believed to be due to element limitation and soil acidity. 
                 
                 
                   
                    To determine the impact of both element limitation and soil acidity on tropical heath forest, we established a soil fertilization experiment to investigate the impact that increased soil N availability and reduced soil pH (using lime/CaCO 
                    3 
                    ) had on a range of elements in tree leaves. We hypothesized that alterations in soil resource availability would cause changes in the tree leaf N:P ratio and concentrations of other elements and these changes would be influenced by species' functional strategies. 
                   
                 
                 
                  The experiment was carried out in a Bornean heath forest on infertile soil over a 2‐year period. We selected 10 common tree species, spanning acquisitive to conservative strategies and tested whether tree species functional strategies influenced tree leaf elemental concentrations after the fertilization. 
                 
                 
                  Leaf N:P ratios showed considerable differences among co‐occurring species. Overall, we found that soil N addition treatments increased leaf N concentration, although leaf N:P ratios were not affected. Changes in leaf Al, Fe and S concentrations were correlated with species functional strategy: conservative species showed a greater increase in leaf Fe compared with acquisitive species, whereas acquisitive species showed a greater increase in leaf Al but a decrease in leaf S compared with conservative species. 
                 
                 
                   
                    Synthesis 
                    . We show that soil elements uptake differs between acquisitive and conservative species and that acquisitive species may not take up soil elemental resources more effectively than conservative species. We suggest that the greater Fe acquisition by conservative species, in comparison to acquisitive species, might be due to a stress tolerance strategy. The overall increase in leaf N showed that, in this nutrient‐poor forest, N is a fundamental requirement irrespective of species functional strategies. Given the increased leaf Al and Fe concentration after liming, we also suggest that these elements are important, and possibly limiting (Fe), in this heath forest.

                  Untuk mengetahui apakah impak kepada hutan kerangas tropika sekiranya terjadi pengehadan dari segi unsur berserta keasidan tanah, kami telah menjalankan satu kajian pembajaan tanah untuk menyiasat kesan peningkatan dalam ketersediaan N tanah bersama penurunan pH tanah (menggunakan kapur/CaCO3) terhadap tahap beberapa jenis unsur dalam daun pokok. Kami berdasarkan hipotesis bahawa perubahan dalam ketersediadaan bekalan tanah akan mengakibatkan perubahan pada nisbah N:P dalam daun pokok dan kepekatan unsur‐unsur lain yangmana perubahan‐perubahan ini akan dipengaruhi oleh strategi‐strategi fungsi mengikut spesies. 
                 
                 
                  Kajian telah dijalankan selama dua tahun di satu hutan kerangas di Borneo dengan tanah yang tidak subur. Dengan memilih sepuluh spesies kayu yang biasa terdapat di situ serta mewakili yang bersifatkan berstrategi akuisitif dan yang berstrategi konservatif, kami telah menguji samada strategi fungsi spesies pokok mempengaruhi tahap kepekatan unsur dalam daun pokok selepas pembajaan. 
                 
                 
                  Nisbah pada N:P daun memperlihatkan perbezaan ketara diantara spesies yang tumbuh bersama. Secara keseluruhan, kami mendapati rawatan penambahan pada N tanah menyebabkan peningkatan pada kepekatan N dalam daun tetapi tidak membawa kesan kepada nisbah N:P daun. Perubahan pada kepekatan Al, Fe dan S daun didapati berkait dengan strategi fungsi spesies: spesies bersifat konservatif menunjukkan peningkatan lebih besar pada Fe daun berbanding dengan spesies bersifat akuisitif manakala spesies akuisitif pula menunjukkan peningkatan lebih tinggi pada Al daun tetapi penurunan pada S daun berbanding spesies konservatif. 
                 
                 
                   
                    Sintesis 
                    . Kami menunjukkan bahawa pemerapan unsur‐unsur tanah berbeza antara spesies bersifat akuisitif dan yang bersifat konservatif, dan kemungkinannya spesies akuisitif tidaklah memerap bekalan unsur tanah lebih cepat dari spesies konservatif. Kami mencadangkan bahawa pemerapan bagi Fe yang lebih tinggi pada spesies konservatif mungkin disebabkan oleh strategi toleransi terhadap tekanan. Peningkatan keseluruhan pada N daun menunjukkan bahawa, bagi hutan miskin nutrien ini, N adalah keperluan asas tanpa mengira strategi fungsi spesies. Melihat peningkatan pada kepekatan Al dan Fe dalam daun selepas penambahan kapur, kami juga mencadangkan bahawa unsur‐unsur tersebut, dan mungkin juga pengehadan (Fe), adalah penting dalam hutan kerangas ini.},

              Great uncertainty exists in the global exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere. An important source of this uncertainty lies in the dependency of photosynthesis on the maximum rate of carboxylation ( 
              V 
              cmax 
              ) and the maximum rate of electron transport ( 
              J 
              max 
              ). Understanding and making accurate prediction of C fluxes thus requires accurate characterization of these rates and their relationship with plant nutrient status over large geographic scales. Plant nutrient status is indicated by the traits: leaf nitrogen (N), leaf phosphorus (P), and specific leaf area ( 
              SLA 
              ). Correlations between 
              V 
              cmax 
              and 
              J 
              max 
              and leaf nitrogen (N) are typically derived from local to global scales, while correlations with leaf phosphorus (P) and specific leaf area ( 
              SLA 
              ) have typically been derived at a local scale. Thus, there is no global‐scale relationship between 
              V 
              cmax 
              and 
              J

              SLA 
              limiting the ability of global‐scale carbon flux models do not account for P or 
              SLA 
              . We gathered published data from 24 studies to reveal global relationships of 
              V 
              cmax 
              and 
              J 
              max 
              with leaf N, P, and 
              SLA 
              . 
              V 
              cmax 
              was strongly related to leaf N, and increasing leaf P substantially increased the sensitivity of 
              V 
              cmax 
              to leaf N. 
              J 
              max 
              was strongly related to 
              V 
              cmax 
              , and neither leaf N, P, or 
              SLA 
              had a substantial impact on the relationship. Although more data are needed to expand the applicability of the relationship, we show leaf P is a globally important determinant of photosynthetic rates. In a model of photosynthesis, we showed that at high leaf N (3 gm 
              −2 
              ), increasing leaf P from 0.05 to 0.22 gm 
              −2 
              nearly doubled assimilation rates. Finally, we show that plants may employ a conservative strategy of 
              J 
              max 
              to 
              V

	abstract = {Abstract. Leaf stoichiometric traits are central to ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycling, yet no accepted theory predicts their variation along environmental gradients. Using data in the China Plant Trait Database version 2, we aimed to characterize variation in leaf carbon and nitrogen per unit mass (Cmass, Nmass) and their ratio and to test an eco-evolutionary optimality model for Nmass. Community-mean trait values were related to climate variables by multiple linear regression. Climatic optima and tolerances of major genera were estimated; Pagel's λ was used to quantify phylogenetic controls, and Bayesian phylogenetic linear mixed models to assess the contributions of climate, species identity, and phylogeny. Optimality-based predictions of community-mean Nmass were compared to observed values. All traits showed strong phylogenetic signals. Climate explained only 18 \% of C:N ratio variation among species but 45 \% among communities, highlighting the role of taxonomic replacement in mediating community-level responses. Geographic distributions of deciduous taxa were separated primarily by moisture and evergreens by temperature. Cmass increased with irradiance but decreased with moisture and temperature. Nmass declined with all three variables. C:N ratio variations were dominated by Nmass. The coefficients relating Nmass to the ratio of maximum carboxylation capacity at 25 ∘C (Vcmax25) and leaf mass per area (Ma) were influenced by leaf area index. The optimality model captured 68 \% and 53 \% of variation between communities for Vcmax25 and Ma, respectively, and 21 \% for Nmass. We conclude that stoichiometric variations along climate gradients are achieved largely by environmental selection among species and clades with different intraspecific trait values. Variations in leaf C:N ratio are mainly determined by Nmass, and optimality-based modelling shows useful predictive ability for community-mean Nmass. These findings should help to improve the representation of C:N coupling in ecosystem models.},

              Carbon (C) enters into the terrestrial ecosystems via photosynthesis and cycles through the system together with other essential nutrients (i.e., nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]). Such a strong coupling of C, N, and P leads to the theoretical prediction that limited nutrient availability will limit photosynthesis rate, plant growth, and future terrestrial C dynamics. However, the lack of reliable information about plant tissue stoichiometric constraints remains a challenge for quantifying nutrient limitations on projected global C cycling. In this study, we harmonized observed plant tissue C:N:P stoichiometry from more than 6,000 plant species with the commonly used plant functional type framework in global land models. Using observed C:N:P stoichiometry and the flexibility of these ratios as emergent plant traits, we show that observationally constrained fixed plant stoichiometry does not improve model estimates of present‐day C dynamics compared with unconstrained stoichiometry. However, adopting stoichiometric flexibility significantly improves model predictions of C fluxes and stocks. The 21st century simulations with RCP8.5 CO 
              2 
              concentrations show that stoichiometric flexibility, rather than baseline stoichiometric ratios, is the dominant controller of plant productivity and ecosystem C accumulation in modeled responses to CO 
              2 
              fertilization. The enhanced nutrient limitations and plant P use efficiency mainly explain this result. This study is consistent with the previous consensus that nutrient availability will limit xfuture land carbon sequestration but challenges the idea that imbalances between C and nutrient supplies and fixed stoichiometry limit future land C sinks. We show here that it is necessary to represent nutrient stoichiometric flexibility in models to accurately project future terrestrial ecosystem carbon sequestration.

	abstract = {Abstract. Terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration is limited by nitrogen (N), an
empirically established constraint that could intensify under CO2
fertilization and future global change. The terrestrial C sink is estimated
to currently sequester approximately a third of annual anthropogenic
CO2 emissions based on an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models,
which have been evaluated in their ability to reproduce observations of the
C, water, and energy cycles. However, their ability to reproduce
observations of N cycling and thus the regulation of terrestrial C
sequestration by N have been largely unexplored. Here, we evaluate an
ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models with coupled C–N cycling and their
performance at simulating N cycling, outlining a framework for evaluating N
cycling that can be applied across terrestrial biosphere models. We find
that models exhibit significant variability across N pools and fluxes,
simulating different magnitudes and trends over the historical period,
despite their ability to generally reproduce the historical terrestrial C
sink. Furthermore, there are no significant correlations between model
performance in simulating N cycling and model performance in simulating C
cycling, nor are there significant differences in model performance between
models with different representations of fundamental N cycling processes.
This suggests that the underlying N processes that regulate terrestrial C
sequestration operate differently across models and appear to be
disconnected from C cycling. Models tend to overestimate tropical biological
N fixation, vegetation C : N ratio, and soil C : N ratio but underestimate
temperate biological N fixation relative to observations. However, there is
significant uncertainty associated with measurements of N cycling processes
given their scarcity (especially relative to those of C cycling processes)
and their high spatiotemporal variability. Overall, our results suggest that
terrestrial biosphere models that represent coupled C–N cycling could be
overestimating C storage per unit N, which could lead to biases in
projections of the future terrestrial C sink under CO2 fertilization
and future global change (let alone those without a representation of N
cycling). More extensive observations of N cycling processes and comparisons
against experimental manipulations are crucial to evaluate N cycling and its
impact on C cycling and guide its development in terrestrial
biosphere models.},

            Plain Language Summary 
             
              As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 
              2 
              ) increases, plants grow more and take up more CO 
              2 
              , which could slow the pace of climate change. However, higher CO 
              2 
              dilutes leaf nutrient concentrations, which could ultimately limit plant growth as CO 
              2 
              continues to rise. The change in leaf chemistry in response to rising CO 
              2 
              is not well represented in models used to predict future productivity and the land carbon sink. By simulating CO 
              2 
              ‐driven changes in leaf chemistry in the Community Land Model, we quantified potential effects of shifting leaf chemistry on future vegetation growth and global C, nutrient, and hydrologic cycles. The new model simulation reduced the strength of the land C sink 2‐fold compared to simulations where foliar chemistry does not change in response to atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . The reduction in plant growth also produced large hydrologic changes, including reduced global evapotranspiration and increased runoff. Nitrogen cycling rates were reduced in the flexible simulation but highlighted a gap in our understanding of aboveground‐belowground feedbacks that warrants further research. Thus, the ways we represent foliar chemistry in models are important for understanding the future conditions of the planet and our capacity to respond to climate change.

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and
their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere
in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon
cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future
climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to
quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their
uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy
statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change
(ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change
data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured
directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual
changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated
with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based
data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with
dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance
(BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the
estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a
measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon
cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 \% relative to 2020, with
fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission
(including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1
(40.0 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.9  ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1, with a
BIM of −0.6 GtC yr−1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or
sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over
2021 reached 414.71 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an
increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 \% (0.1 \% to 1.9 \%)
globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more
than 50 \% above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean
and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently
estimated over the period 1959–2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal
variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple
approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the
estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the
different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern
extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the
strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update
documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global
carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle
compared with previous publications of this data set. The data presented in

            In the context of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, most climate simulations use prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore do not interactively include the effect of carbon cycle feedbacks. However, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario has additionally been run by earth system models with prescribed CO2 emissions. This paper analyzes the climate projections of 11 earth system models (ESMs) that performed both emission-driven and concentration-driven RCP8.5 simulations. When forced by RCP8.5 CO2 emissions, models simulate a large spread in atmospheric CO2; the simulated 2100 concentrations range between 795 and 1145 ppm. Seven out of the 11 ESMs simulate a larger CO2 (on average by 44 ppm, 985 ± 97 ppm by 2100) and hence higher radiative forcing (by 0.25 W m−2) when driven by CO2 emissions than for the concentration-driven scenarios (941 ppm). However, most of these models already overestimate the present-day CO2, with the present-day biases reasonably well correlated with future atmospheric concentrations’ departure from the prescribed concentration. The uncertainty in CO2 projections is mainly attributable to uncertainties in the response of the land carbon cycle. As a result of simulated higher CO2 concentrations than in the concentration-driven simulations, temperature projections are generally higher when ESMs are driven with CO2 emissions. Global surface temperature change by 2100 (relative to present day) increased by 3.9° ± 0.9°C for the emission-driven simulations compared to 3.7° ± 0.7°C in the concentration-driven simulations. Although the lower ends are comparable in both sets of simulations, the highest climate projections are significantly warmer in the emission-driven simulations because of stronger carbon cycle feedbacks.},

              The distribution of assimilated carbon among the plant parts has a profound effect on plant growth, and at a larger scale, on terrestrial biogeochemistry. Although important progress has been made in modelling photosynthesis, less effort has been spent on understanding the carbon allocation, especially at large spatial scales. Whereas several individual‐level models of plant growth include an allocation scheme, most global terrestrial models still assume constant allocation of net primary production (NPP) among plant parts, without any environmental coupling. Here, we use the CASA biosphere model as a platform for exploring a new global allocation scheme that estimates allocation of photosynthesis products among leaves, stems, and roots depending on resource availability. The philosophy underlying the model is that allocation patterns result from evolved responses that adjust carbon investments to facilitate capture of the most limiting resources, i.e. light, water, and mineral nitrogen. In addition, we allow allocation of NPP to vary in response to changes in atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . The relative magnitudes of changes in NPP and resource‐use efficiency control the response of root:shoot allocation. For ambient CO 
              2 
              , the model produces realistic changes in above‐ground allocation along productivity gradients. In comparison to the CASA standard estimate using fixed allocation ratios, the new allocation scheme tends to favour root allocation, leading to a 10\% lower global biomass. Elevated CO 
              2 
              , which alters the balance between growth and available resources, generally leads to reduced water stress and consequently, decreased root:shoot ratio. The major exception is forest ecosystems, where increased nitrogen stress induces a larger root allocation.},

understand terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change because they
measure real responses in real ecosystems and yield insights into causal
relationships. However, their scope is limited in space and time due to
cost and labour intensity. This makes generalising results from such
experiments difficult, which creates a conceptual gap between local-scale
process understanding and global-scale future predictions. Recent efforts
have seen results from such experiments used in combination with dynamic
global vegetation models, most commonly to evaluate model predictions under
global change drivers. However, there is much more potential in combining
models and experiments. Here, we discuss the value and potential of a
workflow for using ecosystem experiments together with process-based models
to enhance the potential of both. We suggest that models can be used prior
to the start of an experiment to generate hypotheses, identify data needs,
and in general guide experimental design. Models, when adequately
constrained with observations, can also predict variables which are
difficult to measure frequently or at all, and together with the data they can
provide a more complete picture of ecosystem states. Finally, models can be
used to help generalise the experimental results in space and time, by
providing a framework in which process understanding derived from site-level
experiments can be incorporated. We also discuss the potential for using
manipulative experiments together with models in formalised model–data
integration frameworks for parameter estimation and model selection, a path
made possible by the increasing number of ecosystem experiments and diverse
observation streams. The ideas presented here can provide a roadmap to
future experiment–model studies.},

              The availability of nitrogen (N) is a critical control on the cycling and storage of soil carbon (C). Yet, there are conflicting conceptual models to explain how N availability influences the decomposition of organic matter by soil microbial communities. Several lines of evidence suggest that N availability limits decomposition; the earliest stages of leaf litter decay are associated with a net import of N from the soil environment, and both observations and models show that high N organic matter decomposes more rapidly. In direct contrast to these findings, experimental additions of inorganic N to soils broadly show a suppression of microbial activity, which is inconsistent with N limitation of decomposition. Resolving this apparent contradiction is critical to representing nutrient dynamics in predictive ecosystem models under a multitude of global change factors that alter soil N availability. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework, the Carbon, Acidity, and Mineral Protection hypothesis, to understand the effects of N availability on soil C cycling and storage and explore the predictions of this framework with a mathematical model. Our model simulations demonstrate that N addition can have opposing effects on separate soil C pools (particulate and mineral‐protected carbon) because they are differentially affected by microbial biomass growth. Moreover, changes in N availability are frequently linked to shifts in soil 
              pH 
              or osmotic stress, which can independently affect microbial biomass dynamics and mask N stimulation of microbial activity. Thus, the net effect of N addition on soil C is dependent upon interactions among microbial physiology, soil mineralogy, and soil acidity. We believe that our synthesis provides a broadly applicable conceptual framework to understand and predict the effect of changes in soil N availability on ecosystem C cycling under global change.},

              The spatial and temporal variations in terrestrial carbon storage play a pivotal role in regulating future climate change. However, Earth system models (ESMs), which have coupled the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere, show great uncertainty in simulating the global land carbon storage. Here, based on multiple global datasets and a traceability analysis, we diagnosed the uncertainty source of terrestrial carbon storage in 22 ESMs that participated in phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). The modeled global terrestrial carbon storage has converged among ESMs from CMIP5 (1936.9 ± 739.3 PgC) to CMIP6 (1774.4 ± 439.0 PgC) but is persistently lower than the observation-based estimates (2285 ± 669 PgC). By further decomposing terrestrial carbon storage into net primary production (NPP) and ecosystem carbon residence time ( 
               
                τ 
                E 
               
              ), we found that the decreased intermodel spread in land carbon storage primarily resulted from more accurate simulations on NPP among ESMs from CMIP5 to CMIP6. The persistent underestimation of land carbon storage was caused by the biased 
               
                τ 
                E 
               
              . In CMIP5 and CMIP6, the modeled

                E 
               
              was far shorter than the observation-based estimates. The potential reasons for the biased

                E 
               
              could be the lack of or incomplete representation of nutrient limitation, vertical soil biogeochemistry, and the permafrost carbon cycle. Moreover, the modeled

                E 
               
              became the key driver for the intermodel spread in global land carbon storage in CMIP6. Overall, our study indicates that CMIP6 models have greatly improved the terrestrial carbon cycle, with a decreased model spread in global terrestrial carbon storage and less uncertain productivity. However, more efforts are needed to understand and reduce the persistent data–model disagreement on carbon storage and residence time in the terrestrial biosphere.},

              The mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic acclimation are not well understood, effectively limiting predictability under future conditions. Least‐cost optimality theory can be used to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity based on the assumption that plants maximize carbon uptake while minimizing the associated costs. Here, we use this theory as a null model in combination with multiple datasets of C 
              3 
              plant photosynthetic traits to elucidate the mechanisms underlying photosynthetic acclimation to elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO 
              2 
              ). The model‐data comparison showed that leaves decrease the ratio of the maximum rate of electron transport to the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation ( 
              J 
              max 
              / 
              V

              2 
              . Finally, our analysis suggested that plants underinvest in electron transport relative to carboxylation under elevated CO

              , limiting potential leaf‐level photosynthesis under future CO

	abstract = {The paper studied the short-term effects of experimental warming, nitrogen fertilization, and their combination on growth and photosynthetic performances of Picea asperata Mast. and Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. seedlings. These seedlings were subjected to two levels of temperature (ambient temperature and infrared heater warming) and two nitrogen levels (0 and 25 g N·m–2·year–1) for 6 months. Warming alone and fertilization alone significantly increased biomass accumulation and photosynthetic performances of both two species. The combination of warming and fertilization stimulated greater accumulation of stem, root, and total biomass and further increased chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis rate (A) in Pinus tabulaeformis seedlings. However, for Picea asperata seedlings, the interaction induced less increment in plant height, total biomass, chlorophyll contents, A, and the efficiency of photosystem than nitrogen treatment alone. These results implied that both climate warming and nitrogen addition were favorable for the early growth of both coniferous species; the interaction of these two factors caused adding or multiplying single-factor effects in the case of Pinus tabulaeformis seedlings but dampening them in the case of Picea asperata seedlings, at least in short time.},

Seedlings were exposed daily to charcoal-filtered air or SO2 at 10, 20, and 40 nl l−1 for two growing seasons.

In Q. serrata, F. crenata, C. sieboldii, and P. densiflora seedlings, the different responses of whole-plant growth to SO2 among the N treatments were because of the effect of N load on the response of the net photosynthetic rate to SO2. L. kaempferi seedlings showed N load-induced tolerance of whole-plant growth to SO2. This was explained by the effect of N load on the responses of photosynthesis and development of assimilative organs to SO2. The different growth responses to SO2 among the N treatments were explained by the effects of N load on the SO2 uptake rate (evaluated by stomatal diffusive conductance) or the accumulated SO2 uptake (evaluated by foliar S concentration).},

	abstract = {Background Soil water and nitrogen (N) are considered to be the main environmental factors limiting plant growth and photosynthetic capacity. However, less is known about the interactive effects of soil water and N on tree growth and photosynthetic response in the temperate ecosystem. Methods/Principal Findings We applied N and water, alone and in combination, and investigated the combined effect of different water and N regimes on growth and photosynthetic responses of Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings. The seedlings were exposed to three water regimes including natural precipitation (CK), higher precipitation (HW) (CK +30\%) and lower precipitation (LW) (CK −30\%), and both with and without N addition for two growing seasons. We demonstrated that water and N supply led to a significant increase in the growth and biomass production of the seedlings. LW treatment significantly decreased biomass production and leaf N content, but they showed marked increases in N addition. N addition could enhance the photosynthetic capability under HW and CK conditions. Leaf chlorophyll content and the initial activity of Rubisco were dramatically increased by N addition regardless of soil water condition. The positive relationships were found between photosynthetic capacity, leaf N content, and SLA in response to water and N supply in the seedling. Rubisco expression was up-regulated by N addition with decreasing soil water content. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the labeling for Rubisco was relatively low in leaves of the seedlings under LW condition. The accumulation of Rubisco was increased in leaf tissues of LW by N addition. Conclusions/Significance Our study has presented better understanding of the interactions between soil water and N on the growth and photosynthetic response in F. mandschurica seedlings, which may provide novel insights on the potential responses of the forest ecosystem to climate change associated with increasing N deposition.},

              Nitrogen (N) addition typically increases overall plant growth, but the nature of this response depends upon patterns of plant nitrogen allocation that vary throughout the growing season and depend upon canopy position. In this study seasonal variations in leaf traits were investigated across a canopy profile in Miscanthus ( 
              Miscanthus × giganteus 
              ) under two N treatments (0 and 224 kg ha 
              −1 
              ) to determine whether the growth response of Miscanthus to N fertilization was related to the response of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen allocation. Miscanthus yielded 24.1 Mg ha 
              −1 
              in fertilized plots, a 40\% increase compared to control plots. Photosynthetic properties, such as net photosynthesis (A), maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation (V 
              cmax 
              ), stomatal conductance (g 
              s

              SLA 
              ) and leaf area index ( 
              LAI 
              ). Leaf N concentration in different canopy layers was increased by N fertilization and the distribution of N concentration within canopy followed irradiance gradients. These results show that the positive effect of N fertilization on the yield of Miscanthus was unrelated to changes in photosynthetic rates but was achieved mainly by increased canopy leaf area. Vertical measurements through the canopy demonstrated that Miscanthus adapted to the light environment by adjusting leaf morphological and biochemical properties independent of nitrogen treatments.

Ammonium sulfate was supplied to half of the plots of each soil type in 2008 and 2009, at a load of 47kgNha−1year−1. Although the growth and photosynthetic capacity of hybrid larch F1 seedlings in the serpentine soil were limited, the rate of growth in serpentine soil was greater than that of Sakhalin spruce (Picea glehnii) that is dominant species in serpentine regions. There was significant interaction between soil type and N load for the growth and photosynthetic parameters. The N load adversely affected growth and photosynthetic parameters in the serpentine soil, while improved them in brown forest soil.

	abstract = {The response of carbon (C) allocation in pine seedlings to a gradient of nitrogen (N) addition was evaluated to examine the effects of increasing N deposition on forest trees. Seedlings of Pinus tabulaeformis were subject to N addition treatments (0–22.4gNm−2yr−1) for 3years and the short-term allocation of a 13C photosynthetic pulse into leaves, stems, different order roots and soil was traced. Photosynthetic rate, roots respiration, biomass and N concentration of foliage and roots with root branching orders were also measured. It was found that the physiological performance of seedlings exhibited a modal response, peaking at 11.2gNm−2yr−1. The highest N treatment (22.4gNm−2yr−1) had detrimental effects on seedling physiological function (photosynthesis, root respiration) and was strongly decoupled from N concentrations in plant tissues. In agreement with the functional equilibrium hypothesis, root:leaf biomass ratio declined with N addition up to 11.2gNm−2yr−1. The hypothesis states that a stable ratio of resource acquisition by shoots and roots is maintained in the face of constraints, so that one organ does not greatly outgrow the other and overall plant performance is optimized. This response was most pronounced when expressed on the basis of the lowest order roots. Allocation of C to fine roots compared to coarse roots increased with N availability up to the highest N treatment. Soil C flux declined significantly with excess N supply. The results support a “shared control” concept of root C allocation, in which the allocation of C to roots depends on both supply from the shoot and demand from the roots. This provides new insights into the effects of increasing soil N supply on pine seedling physiology and root carbon supply.},

We used an ecophysiological approach to study the effects of N additions on uptake and partitioning of C and N in two dominant understory shrubs: deciduous Vaccinium myrtillus in a Picea abies stand and evergreen Vaccinium vitis-idaea in a Pinus sylvestris stand in northern Sweden. N was added to these stands for 16 and 8 years, respectively, at rates of 0, 12.5, and 50 kg N ha−1 year−1. N addition at the highest rate increased foliar N and chlorophyll concentrations in both understory species. Canopy cover of P. abies also increased, decreasing light availability and leaf mass per area of V. myrtillus. Among leaves of either shrub, foliar N content did not explain variation in light-saturated CO2 exchange rates. Instead photosynthetic capacity varied with stomatal conductance possibly reflecting plant hydraulic properties and within-site variation in water availability. Moreover, likely due to increased shading under P. abies and due to water limitations in the sandy soil under P. sylvestris, individuals of the two shrubs did not increase their biomass or shift their allocation between above- and belowground parts in response to N additions. Altogether, our results indicate that the understory shrubs in these systems show little response to N additions in terms of photosynthetic physiology or growth and that changes in their performance are mostly associated with responses of the tree canopy.},

In P. densiflora seedlings, needle concentrations of P and Mg were decreased, and the concentrations of N and Mn were increased by the highest N treatment. The reductions in needle protein concentration and Rubisco activity were negatively correlated with the ratios of N/P and Mn/Mg in the needles. These results suggest that nutrient imbalances of these elements may be induced in P. densiflora seedlings grown under high N deposition. We conclude that P. densiflora is more sensitive to high N deposition than C. japonica, and that the relatively high atmospheric N deposition to Japanese forest ecosystems may adversely affect the health of N-sensitive tree species such as P. densiflora.},

	abstract = {A recently developed hybrid larch F1 (F1: Larix gmelinii var. japonica × L. kaempferi) is being planted widely in re- and afforestation projects in northeast Asia. Nitrogen (N) deposition to forest ecosystems has been rapidly increasing in this region, due mainly to industrialization and overuse of N fertilizer. Together with excess N, phosphorus (P) is considered to be the key determinant of tree growth in northeast Asia, because most soils have originated from immature volcanic ash. To predict the response of the F1 to increasing N deposition and its relation with soil P availability related to immature volcanic ash soil in northern Japan, planting stocks of F1 were grown in potted brown forest soil and categorised into eight treatments, comprising four N treatments covering the amount of N deposition observed and predicted in northeast Asia in combination with two P levels. N application increased the biomass and the light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (Asat) of the F1 at all concentrations. Despite expectations, P did not have any effect on these parameters. As N application increased the content of potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and chlorophyll (Chl) in needles, a positive correlation was found between the content of N, K, P and Asat. These results suggest that N deposition improves the growth of the hybrid larch F1 at least by improving the needle N condition, as well as the concentration of other macronutrients in the initial stage of plantation.},

We conducted a short-term shading and nitrogen (N) addition experiment from June to September 2013 to investigate the effect of photosynthate supply by Manchurian Ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) seedlings on soil respiration (SR). Shading significantly reduced SR in early and middle growing season, but not in late growing season, leading to a decrease in mean SR by 24 \% in N-unfertilized treatments. N addition increased mean SR by 42 \% in un-shaded treatment. The stimulation of SR was largely attributed to accelerated autotrophic respiration by increasing photosynthesis, leaf area index and belowground biomass. Shading reduced mean SR by 32 \% in N addition treatment. The strengthened shading effect on SR resulted from N addition was because of more photosynthates supply at low soil temperature. Our findings highlight the predominance of photosynthates supply in regulating the responses of C cycling to global change.},

We quantitatively explain the observed divergent latitudinal trends in evergreen and deciduous LMA and show how local distributions of LMA arise by selection under different environmental conditions acting on the species pool.

Here we adapt this framework for understanding the way plants use water and nitrogen (N) in photosynthesis. The least-cost input mixture for generating a given output depends on the relative cost of procuring and using nitrogen versus water. This way of considering the issue integrates concepts such as water-use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency into the more inclusive objective of optimizing the input mix for a given situation. We explore the implications of deploying alternative combinations of leaf nitrogen concentration and stomatal conductance to water, focusing on comparing hypothetical species occurring in low- versus high-humidity habitats. We then present data from sites in both the United States and Australia and show that low-rainfall species operate with substantially higher leaf N concentration per unit leaf area. The extra protein reflected in higher leaf N concentration is associated with a greater drawdown of internal CO2, such that low-rainfall species achieve higher photosynthetic rates at a given stomatal conductance. This restraint of transpirational water use apparently counterbalances the multiple costs of deploying high-nitrogen leaves.},

	abstract = {Land models are often used to simulate terrestrial responses to future environmental changes, but these models are not commonly evaluated with data from experimental manipulations. Results from experimental manipulations can identify and evaluate model assumptions that are consistent with appropriate ecosystem responses to future environmental change. We conducted simulations using three coupled carbon-nitrogen versions of the Community Land Model (CLM, versions 4, 4.5, and—the newly developed—5), and compared the simulated response to nitrogen (N) and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment with meta-analyses of observations from similar experimental manipulations. In control simulations, successive versions of CLM showed a poleward increase in gross primary productivity and an overall bias reduction, compared to FLUXNET-MTE observations. Simulations with N and CO2 enrichment demonstrate that CLM transitioned from a model that exhibited strong nitrogen limitation of the terrestrial carbon cycle (CLM4) to a model that showed greater responsiveness to elevated concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere (CLM5). Overall, CLM5 simulations showed better agreement with observed ecosystem responses to experimental N and CO2 enrichment than previous versions of the model. These simulations also exposed shortcomings in structural assumptions and parameterizations. Specifically, no version of CLM captures changes in plant physiology, allocation, and nutrient uptake that are likely important aspects of terrestrial ecosystems' responses to environmental change. These highlight priority areas that should be addressed in future model developments. Moving forward, incorporating results from experimental manipulations into model benchmarking tools that are used to evaluate model performance will help increase confidence in terrestrial carbon cycle projections.},

Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO2 effect on biomass based on 138 eCO2 experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in {\textasciitilde}65\% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in {\textasciitilde}25\% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 ± 3\% above current values, equivalent to 59 ± 13 PgC. The future effect of eCO2 we derive from experiments is geographically consistent with past changes in greenness9, but is considerably lower than the past effect derived from models10. If borne out, our results suggest that the stimulatory effect of CO2 on carbon storage could slow considerably this century.

              Nutrient availability influences virtually every aspect of an ecosystem, and is a critical modifier of ecosystem responses to global change. Although this crucial role of nutrient availability in regulating ecosystem structure and functioning has been widely acknowledged, nutrients are still often neglected in observational and experimental synthesis studies due to difficulties in comparing the nutrient status across sites. In the current study, we explain different nutrient‐related concepts and discuss the potential of soil‐, plant‐ and remote sensing‐based metrics to compare the nutrient status across space. Based on our review and additional analyses on a dataset of European, managed temperate and boreal forests (ICP [International Co‐operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests] Forests dataset), we conclude that the use of plant‐ and remote sensing‐based metrics that rely on tissue stoichiometry is limited due to their strong dependence on species identity. The potential use of other plant‐based metrics such as Ellenberg indicator values and plant‐functional traits is also discussed. We conclude from our analyses and review that soil‐based metrics have the highest potential for successful intersite comparison of the nutrient status. As an example, we used and adjusted a soil‐based metric, previously developed for conifer forests across Sweden, against the same ICP Forests data. We suggest that this adjusted and further adaptable metric, which included the organic carbon concentration in the upper 20 cm of the soil (including the organic fermentation‐humus [FH] layer), the C:N ratio and 
               
              of the FH layer, can be used as a complementary tool along with other indicators of nutrient availability, to compare the background nutrient status across temperate and boreal forests dominated by spruce, pine or beech. Future collection and provision of harmonized soil data from observational and experimental sites is crucial for further testing and adjusting the metric.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of leaf chemistry, physiology, and life span is essential for global vegetation modeling, but such data are scarce or lacking for some regions, especially in developing countries. Here we use data from 2021 species at 175 sites around the world from the GLOPNET compilation to show that key physiological traits that are difficult to measure (such as photosynthetic capacity) can be predicted from simple qualitative plant characteristics, climate information, easily measured ("soft") leaf traits, or all of these in combination. The qualitative plant functional type (PFT) attributes examined are phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), growth form (grass, herb, shrub, or tree), and leaf phenology (deciduous vs. evergreen). These three PFT attributes explain between one-third and two-thirds of the variation in each of five quantitative leaf ecophysiological traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf life span, mass-based net photosynthetic capacity (Amass), nitrogen content (N(mass)), and phosphorus content (P(mass)). Alternatively, the combination of four simple, widely available climate metrics (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean vapor pressure deficit, and solar irradiance) explain only 5-20\% of the variation in those same five leaf traits. Adding the climate metrics to the qualitative PFTs as independent factors in the model increases explanatory power by 3-11\% for the five traits. If a single easily measured leaf trait (SLA) is also included in the model along with qualitative plant traits and climate metrics, an additional 5-25\% of the variation in the other four other leaf traits is explained, with the models accounting for 62\%, 65\%, 66\%, and 73\% of global variation in N(mass), P(mass), A(mass), and leaf life span, respectively. Given the wide availability of the summary climate data and qualitative PFT data used in these analyses, they could be used to explain roughly half of global variation in the less accessible leaf traits (A(mass), leaf life span, N(mass), P(mass)); this can be augmented to two-thirds of all variation if climatic and PFT data are used in combination with the readily measured trait SLA. This shows encouraging possibilities of progress in developing general predictive equations for macro-ecology, global scaling, and global modeling.},

Analysis of data on woody species from contrasting climates (cold-hot, dry-wet) yielded steeper slopes and lower mean ci/ca ratios at the dry or cold sites than at the wet or hot sites. High atmospheric vapour pressure deficit implies low ci/ca in dry climates. High water viscosity (more costly transport) and low photorespiration (less costly photosynthesis) imply low ci/ca in cold climates. Observed site-mean ci/ca shifts are predicted quantitatively for temperature contrasts (by photorespiration plus viscosity effects) and approximately for aridity contrasts. The theory explains the dependency of ci/ca ratios on temperature and vapour pressure deficit, and observed relationships of leaf δ13C and Narea to aridity.},

	abstract = {There is huge uncertainty about how global exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere and land will respond to continuing environmental change. A better representation of photosynthetic capacity is required for Earth System models to simulate carbon assimilation reliably. Here we use a global leaf-trait dataset to test whether photosynthetic capacity is quantitatively predictable from climate, based on optimality principles; and to explore how this prediction is modified by soil properties, including indices of nitrogen and phosphorus availability, measured in situ. The maximum rate of carboxylation standardized to 25 °C (Vcmax25) was found to be proportional to growing-season irradiance, and to increase—as predicted—towards both colder and drier climates. Individual species’ departures from predicted Vcmax25 covaried with area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea) but community-mean Vcmax25 was unrelated to Narea, which in turn was unrelated to the soil C:N ratio. In contrast, leaves with low area-based phosphorus (Parea) had low Vcmax25 (both between and within communities), and Parea increased with total soil P. These findings do not support the assumption, adopted in some ecosystem and Earth System models, that leaf-level photosynthetic capacity depends on soil N supply. They do, however, support a previously-noted relationship between photosynthesis and soil P supply.},

	abstract = {We quantified the biomass allocation patterns to leaves, stems and roots in vegetative plants, and how this is influenced by the growth environment, plant size, evolutionary history and competition. Dose–response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology. Contents Summary 30 I. Allocation in perspective 31 II. Topics of this review 32 III.

	abstract = {Several publications have examined leaf-trait and carbon-cycling shifts along an Amazon–Andes transect spanning 3.5 km in elevation and 16°C in mean annual temperature. Photosynthetic capacity was previously shown to increase as temperature declines with increasing elevation, counteracting enzyme-kinetic effects. Primary production declines, nonetheless, due to decreasing light availability. We aimed to predict leaf-trait and production gradients from first principles, using published data to test an emerging theory whereby photosynthetic traits and primary production depend on optimal acclimation and/or adaptation to environment. We re-analysed published data for 210 species at 25 sites, fitting linear relationships to elevation for both predicted and observed photosynthetic traits and primary production. Declining leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratio (χ) and increasing carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron-transport (Jmax) capacities with increasing elevation were predicted. Increases in leaf nitrogen content with elevation were explained by increasing Vcmax and leaf mass-per-area. Leaf and soil phosphorus covaried, but after controlling for elevation, no nutrient metric accounted for any additional variance in photosynthetic traits. Primary production was predicted to decline with elevation. This analysis unifies leaf and ecosystem observations in a common theoretical framework. The insensitivity of primary production to temperature is shown to emerge as a consequence of the optimisation of photosynthetic traits.},

	abstract = {Northern mid-latitude forests are a large terrestrial carbon sink1,2,3,4. Ignoring nutrient limitations, large increases in carbon sequestration from carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization are expected in these forests5. Yet, forests are usually relegated to sites of moderate to poor fertility, where tree growth is often limited by nutrient supply, in particular nitrogen6,7. Here we present evidence that estimates of increases in carbon sequestration of forests, which is expected to partially compensate for increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, are unduly optimistic8. In two forest experiments on maturing pines exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, the CO2-induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients was undetectable at a nutritionally poor site, and the stimulation at a nutritionally moderate site was transient, stabilizing at a marginal gain after three years. However, a large synergistic gain from higher CO2 and nutrients was detected with nutrients added. This gain was even larger at the poor site (threefold higher than the expected additive effect) than at the moderate site (twofold higher). Thus, fertility can restrain the response of wood carbon sequestration to increased atmospheric CO2. Assessment of future carbon sequestration should consider the limitations imposed by soil fertility, as well as interactions with nitrogen deposition.},

                  Photosynthetic ‘least‐cost’ theory posits that the optimal trait combination for a given environment is that where the summed costs of photosynthetic water and nutrient acquisition/use are minimised. The effects of soil water and nutrient availability on photosynthesis should be stronger as climate‐related costs for both resources increase. 
                 
                 
                   
                    Two independent datasets of photosynthetic traits, 
                    Globamax 
                    (1509 species, 288 sites) and 
                    Glob13C 
                    (3645 species, 594 sites), were used to quantify biophysical and biochemical limitations of photosynthesis and the key variable

                    The biochemical photosynthetic capacity was higher on alkaline soils. This effect was strongest at more arid sites, where water unit‐costs are presumably higher. Higher values of soil silt and depth increased

	abstract = {Plant traits-the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants-determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits-almost complete coverage for 'plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait-environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of plant photosynthetic response is needed to reliably predict changes in terrestrial carbon (C) gain under conditions of chronically elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, using 2,683 observations from 240 journal articles, we conducted a global meta-analysis to reveal effects of N addition on 14 photosynthesis-related traits and affecting moderators. We found that across 320 terrestrial plant species, leaf N was enhanced comparably on mass basis (Nmass, +18.4\%) and area basis (Narea, +14.3\%), with no changes in specific leaf area or leaf mass per area. Total leaf area (TLA) was increased significantly, as indicated by the increases in total leaf biomass (+46.5\%), leaf area per plant (+29.7\%), and leaf area index (LAI, +24.4\%). To a lesser extent than for TLA, N addition significantly enhanced leaf photosynthetic rate per area (Aarea, +12.6\%), stomatal conductance (gs, +7.5\%), and transpiration rate (E, +10.5\%). The responses of Aarea were positively related with that of gs, with no changes in instantaneous water-use efficiency and only slight increases in long-term water-use efficiency (+2.5\%) inferred from 13C composition. The responses of traits depended on biological, experimental, and environmental moderators. As experimental duration and N load increased, the responses of LAI and Aarea diminished while that of E increased significantly. The observed patterns of increases in both TLA and E indicate that N deposition will increase the amount of water used by plants. Taken together, N deposition will enhance gross photosynthetic C gain of the terrestrial plants while increasing their water loss to the atmosphere, but the effects on C gain might diminish over time and that on plant water use would be amplified if N deposition persists.},

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time-evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5.},

            Global vegetation and land‐surface models embody interdisciplinary scientific understanding of the behaviour of plants and ecosystems, and are indispensable to project the impacts of environmental change on vegetation and the interactions between vegetation and climate. However, systematic errors and persistently large differences among carbon and water cycle projections by different models highlight the limitations of current process formulations. In this review, focusing on core plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying hypotheses derived from eco‐evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide novel, parameter‐sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of core, leaf‐level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence. EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models. EEO approaches to other important traits, including the leaf economics spectrum and applications of EEO at the community level are active research areas. Independently tested modules emerging from EEO studies could profitably be integrated into modelling frameworks that account for the multiple time scales on which plants and plant communities adjust to environmental change.},

              Nutrient limitation is pervasive in the terrestrial biosphere, although the relationship between global carbon (C) nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles remains uncertain. Using meta‐analysis we show that gross primary production ( 
              GPP 
              ) partitioning belowground is inversely related to soil‐available N : P, increasing with latitude from tropical to boreal forests. N‐use efficiency is highest in boreal forests, and P‐use efficiency in tropical forests. High C partitioning belowground in boreal forests reflects a 13‐fold greater C cost of N acquisition compared to the tropics. By contrast, the C cost of P acquisition varies only 2‐fold among biomes. This analysis suggests a new hypothesis that the primary limitation on productivity in forested ecosystems transitions from belowground resources at high latitudes to aboveground resources at low latitudes as C‐intensive root‐ and mycorrhizal‐mediated nutrient capture is progressively replaced by rapidly cycling, enzyme‐derived nutrient fluxes when temperatures approach the thermal optimum for biogeochemical transformations.},

	abstract = {Plants and vegetation play a critical—but largely unpredictable—role in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.},

              The observed global net land carbon sink is captured by current land models. All models agree that atmospheric CO

              and nitrogen deposition driven gains in carbon stocks are partially offset by climate and land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) losses. However, there is a lack of consensus in the partitioning of the sink between vegetation and soil, where models do not even agree on the direction of change in carbon stocks over the past 60 years. This uncertainty is driven by plant productivity, allocation, and turnover response to atmospheric CO 
              2 
              (and to a smaller extent to LULCC), and the response of soil to LULCC (and to a lesser extent climate). Overall, differences in turnover explain {\textasciitilde}70\% of model spread in both vegetation and soil carbon changes. Further analysis of internal plant and soil (individual pools) cycling is needed to reduce uncertainty in the controlling processes behind the global land carbon sink.},

                    ) are key traits for plant functional ecology and ecosystem modelling. There is however no consensus about how these traits are regulated, or how they should be modelled. Here we confirm that observed leaf nitrogen across species and sites can be estimated well from observed LMA and

                    mass

                  Measurements were made on 705 species from 116 sites within a broad north–south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Trait responses to environment were quantified using multiple regression; within‐ and between‐species responses were compared using analysis of covariance and trait‐gradient analysis.

                    ) and χ (from stable carbon isotope ratios) varied almost independently among species. Across sites, however, χ and LA increased with mean growing‐season temperature (mGDD

	abstract = {Nitrogen content per unit leaf area (Narea) is a key variable in plant functional ecology and biogeochemistry. Narea comprises a structural component, which scales with leaf mass per area (LMA), and a metabolic component, which scales with Rubisco capacity. The co-ordination hypothesis, as implemented in LPJ and related global vegetation models, predicts that Rubisco capacity should be directly proportional to irradiance but should decrease with increases in ci : ca and temperature because the amount of Rubisco required to achieve a given assimilation rate declines with increases in both. We tested these predictions using LMA, leaf δ13C, and leaf N measurements on complete species assemblages sampled at sites on a north–south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Partial effects of mean canopy irradiance, mean annual temperature, and ci : ca (from δ13C) on Narea were all significant and their directions and magnitudes were in line with predictions. Over 80 \% of the variance in community-mean (ln) Narea was accounted for by these predictors plus LMA. Moreover, Narea could be decomposed into two components, one proportional to LMA (slightly steeper in N-fixers), and the other to Rubisco capacity as predicted by the co-ordination hypothesis. Trait gradient analysis revealed ci : ca to be perfectly plastic, while species turnover contributed about half the variation in LMA and Narea. 

 Interest has surged in methods to predict continuous leaf-trait variation from environmental factors, in order to improve ecosystem models. Coupled carbon–nitrogen models require a method to predict Narea that is more realistic than the widespread assumptions that Narea is proportional to photosynthetic capacity, and/or that Narea (and photosynthetic capacity) are determined by N supply from the soil. Our results indicate that Narea has a useful degree of predictability, from a combination of LMA and ci : ca – themselves in part environmentally determined – with Rubisco activity, as predicted from local growing conditions. This finding is consistent with a plant-centred approach to modelling, emphasizing the adaptive regulation of traits. Models that account for biodiversity will also need to partition community-level trait variation into components due to phenotypic plasticity and/or genotypic differentiation within species vs. progressive species replacement, along environmental gradients. Our analysis suggests that variation in Narea is about evenly split between these two modes.},

terrestrial biosphere is a recent progression in earth system models. As
with any new component of a model, it is important to understand the
behaviour, strengths, and limitations of the various process
representations. Here we assess and compare five land surface models with
nitrogen cycles that are used as the terrestrial components of some of the
earth system models in CMIP6. The land surface models were run offline with
a common spin-up and forcing protocol. We use a historical control
simulation and two perturbations to assess the model nitrogen-related
performances: a simulation with atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 200 ppm and one with nitrogen deposition increased by 50 kgN ha−1 yr−1. There is generally greater variability in productivity response
between models to increased nitrogen than to carbon dioxide. Across the five
models the response to carbon dioxide globally was 5 \% to 20 \% and the
response to nitrogen was 2 \% to 24 \%. The models are not evenly distributed
within the ensemble range, with two of the models having low productivity
response to nitrogen and another one with low response to elevated atmospheric
carbon dioxide, compared to the other models. In all five models individual
grid cells tend to exhibit bimodality, with either a strong response to
increased nitrogen or atmospheric carbon dioxide but rarely to both to an
equal extent. However, this local effect does not scale to either the
regional or global level. The global and tropical responses are generally
more accurately modelled than boreal, tundra, or other high-latitude areas
compared to observations. These results are due to divergent choices in the
representation of key nitrogen cycle processes. They show the need for more
observational studies to enhance understanding of nitrogen cycle processes,
especially nitrogen-use efficiency and biological nitrogen fixation.},

              ) and a century later (0.3–6.6 Pg C y 
              −1 
              ) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the ‘diminishing return’ of physiological CO 
              2 
              effects at high CO 
              2 
              concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate‐induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO 
              2 
              concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO

              and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are increasing nutrient inputs to ecosystems worldwide, with consequences for global carbon and nutrient cycles. Recent meta-analyses show that aboveground primary production is often co-limited by multiple nutrients; however, little is known about how root production responds to changes in nutrient availability. At twenty-nine grassland sites on four continents, we quantified shallow root biomass responses to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium plus micronutrient enrichment and compared below- and aboveground responses. We hypothesized that optimal allocation theory would predict context dependence in root biomass responses to nutrient enrichment, given variation among sites in the resources limiting to plant growth (specifically light versus nutrients). Consistent with the predictions of optimal allocation theory, the proportion of total biomass belowground declined with N or P addition, due to increased biomass aboveground (for N and P) and decreased biomass belowground (N, particularly in sites with low canopy light penetration). Absolute root biomass increased with N addition where light was abundant at the soil surface, but declined in sites where the grassland canopy intercepted a large proportion of incoming light. These results demonstrate that belowground responses to changes in resource supply can differ strongly from aboveground responses, which could significantly modify predictions of future rates of nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. Our results also highlight how optimal allocation theory developed for individual plants may help predict belowground biomass responses to nutrient enrichment at the ecosystem scale across wide climatic and environmental gradients.},

       We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C4 photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O2 between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats An as first order with respect to either light, CO2 or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (TI), intercellular CO2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux.  
       A simple linear model of g in terms of An and leaf surface CO2 level (ps) and relative humidity (hs) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T1 and ps and hs levels.  
       Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO2 and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data.  
       Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on An and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO2. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO2 and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.},

            Plant nitrogen acquisition requires carbon to be allocated belowground to build roots and sustain microbial associations. This carbon cost to acquire nitrogen varies by nitrogen acquisition strategy; however, the degree to which these costs vary due to nitrogen availability or demand has not been well tested under controlled conditions. We grew a species capable of forming associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Glycine max) and a species not capable of forming such associations (Gossypium hirsutum) under four soil nitrogen levels to manipulate nitrogen availability and four light levels to manipulate nitrogen demand in a full-factorial greenhouse experiment. We quantified carbon costs to acquire nitrogen as the ratio of total root carbon to whole-plant nitrogen within each treatment combination. In both species, light availability increased carbon costs due to a larger increase in root carbon than whole-plant nitrogen, while nitrogen fertilization generally decreased carbon costs due to a larger increase in whole-plant nitrogen than root carbon. Nodulation data indicated that G. max shifted relative carbon allocation from nitrogen fixation to direct uptake with increased nitrogen fertilization. These findings suggest that carbon costs to acquire nitrogen are modified by changes in light and nitrogen availability in species with and without associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.},

              By means of meta‐analyses we determined how 70 traits related to plant anatomy, morphology, chemistry, physiology, growth and reproduction are affected by daily light integral (

              DLI 
              in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10‐fold increase over the

              DLI 
              (up to three‐fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to 
              DLI 
              . However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade‐tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.},

We introduce a new mathematical model of plant N acquisition, called Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN), based on active and passive soil N uptake, leaf N retranslocation, and biological N fixation. This model is unified under the theoretical framework of carbon (C) cost economics, or resource optimization. FUN specifies C allocated to N acquisition as well as remaining C for growth, or N‐limitation to growth. We test the model with data from a wide range of sites (observed versus predicted N uptake

              Responses of the terrestrial biosphere to rapidly changing environmental conditions are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. In an effort to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO 
              2 
              , temperature, and nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence. These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment responses across 3644 manipulation experiments at 1145 sites, simulating elevated CO 
              2 
              , warming, nutrient addition, and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration, and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database indicates that most experiments are short term (one or few growing seasons), conducted in the USA, Europe, or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground biomass. We provide the most comprehensive multifactor global change database to date, enabling the research community to tackle open research questions, vital to global policymaking. The MESI database, freely accessible at 
              doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7153253

The objectives were to determine how plant growth responded to the availability of C and N in the long term and how the supply of N to the plant from the two sources of N in the soil, soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral fertilizer, varied over time. In three field experiments, 
              15 
              N‐labelled fertilizer was used to distinguish the sources of available N. 
             
             
              In 1993, harvestable biomass under elevated pCO 
              2 
              was 7\% higher than under ambient pCO 
              2 
              . This relative pCO 
              2 
              response increased to 32\% in 2002 at high N, but remained low at low N. Between 1993 and 2002, the proportions and amounts of N in harvestable biomass derived from SOM (excluding remobilized fertilizer) were, at high N, increasingly higher at elevated pCO 
              2 
              than at ambient pCO 
              2 
              . Two factorial experiments confirmed that at high N, but not at low N, a higher proportion of N in harvestable biomass was derived from soil (including remobilized fertilizer) following 7 and 9 years of elevated pCO 
              2 
              , when compared with ambient pCO 
              2 
              . 
             
             
              It is suggested that N availability in the soil initially limited the pCO 
              2 
              response of harvestable biomass. At high N, the limitation of plant growth decreased over time as a result of the stimulated mobilization of N from soil, especially from SOM. Consequently, harvestable biomass increasingly responded to elevated pCO 
              2 
              . The underlying mechanisms which contributed to the increased mobilization of N from SOM under elevated pCO 
              2 
              are discussed. This study demonstrated that there are feedback mechanisms in the soil which are only revealed during long‐term field experiments. Such investigations are thus, a prerequisite for understanding the responses of ecosystems to elevated pCO

            Understanding the chemical composition of our planet's crust was one of the biggest questions of the 20th century. More than 100 years later, we are still far from understanding the global patterns in the bioavailability and spatial coupling of elements in topsoils worldwide, despite their importance for the productivity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we measured the bioavailability and coupling of thirteen macro‐ and micronutrients and phytotoxic elements in topsoils (3–8 cm) from a range of terrestrial ecosystems across all continents (∼10,000 observations) and in response to global change manipulations (∼5,000 observations). For this, we incubated between 1 and 4 pairs of anionic and cationic exchange membranes per site for a mean period of 53 days. The most bioavailable elements (Ca, Mg, and K) were also amongst the most abundant in the crust. Patterns of bioavailability were biome‐dependent and controlled by soil properties such as pH, organic matter content and texture, plant cover, and climate. However, global change simulations resulted in important alterations in the bioavailability of elements. Elements were highly coupled, and coupling was predictable by the atomic properties of elements, particularly mass, mass to charge ratio, and second ionization energy. Deviations from the predictable coupling‐atomic mass relationship were attributed to global change and agriculture. Our work illustrates the tight links between the bioavailability and coupling of topsoil elements and environmental context, human activities, and atomic properties of elements, thus deeply enhancing our integrated understanding of the biogeochemical connections that underlie the productivity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in a changing world.

                    The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis–Menten ( 
                    MM 
                    ) function of soil‐N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil‐N transport processes that determine soil‐N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the 
                    MM 
                    relationship nor soil‐N transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. 
                   
                 
                 
                  Processes governing N supply to roots – diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by soil microbes – are incorporated in a model of root‐N uptake. We highlight a seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. 
                 
                 
                  Root‐N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The results point to a benefit of root switching from high‐ to low‐affinity N transport systems in the presence of mass flow. 
                 
                 
                  Simulations indicate a strong impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass flow.

            Plants invest a considerable amount of leaf nitrogen in the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), forming a strong coupling of nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity. Variability in the nitrogen-photosynthesis relationship indicates different nitrogen use strategies of plants (i.e., the fraction nitrogen allocated to RuBisCO; fLNR), however, the reason for this remains unclear as widely different nitrogen use strategies are adopted in photosynthesis models. Here, we use a comprehensive database of in situ observations, a remote sensing product of leaf chlorophyll and ancillary climate and soil data, to examine the global distribution in fLNR using a random forest model. We find global fLNR is 18.2 ± 6.2\%, with its variation largely driven by negative dependence on leaf mass per area and positive dependence on leaf phosphorus. Some climate and soil factors (i.e., light, atmospheric dryness, soil pH, and sand) have considerable positive influences on fLNR regionally. This study provides insight into the nitrogen-photosynthesis relationship of plants globally and an improved understanding of the global distribution of photosynthetic potential.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Results from the fully and biogeochemically coupled simulations in which CO2 increases at a rate of 1 \% yr−1 (1pctCO2) from its preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of carbon–concentration and carbon–climate feedback parameters which measure the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate, respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The strength of the carbon–concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes over land (mean ± standard deviation = 0.97 ± 0.40 PgC ppm−1) and ocean (0.79 ± 0.07 PgC ppm−1), while the carbon–climate feedback over land (−45.1 ± 50.6 PgC ∘C−1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (−17.2 ± 5.0 PgC ∘C−1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is 1.77 ± 0.37 ∘C EgC−1 and is similar to that found in CMIP5 models (1.63 ± 0.48 ∘C EgC−1) but with somewhat reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation are simplified when the small temperature change in the biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon cycle models.},

Although plant photosynthetic capacity as determined by the maximum carboxylation rate (i.e., Vc, max25) and the maximum electron transport rate (i.e., Jmax25) at a reference temperature (generally 25 °C) is known to vary considerably in space and time in response to environmental conditions, it is typically parameterized in Earth system models (ESMs) with tabulated values associated with plant functional types. In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA) to predict photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions. We adopt an optimality hypothesis to nitrogen allocation among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation and respiration. The LUNA model is able to reasonably capture the measured spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthetic capacity as it explains  ∼  55 \% of the global variation in observed values of Vc, max25 and  ∼  65 \% of the variation in the observed values of Jmax25. Model simulations with LUNA under current and future climate conditions demonstrate that modeled values of Vc, max25 are most affected in high-latitude regions under future climates. ESMs that relate the values of Vc, max25 or Jmax25 to plant functional types only are likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.},

              Abstract
              
                Mycorrhizal fungi influence plant growth, local biodiversity and ecosystem function. Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta‐analysis with information theory‐based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group and N‐fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation (‘plant response’) than other factors. Non‐N‐fixing forbs and woody plants and C
                4
                grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N‐fixing bacterial symbionts and C
                3
                grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P‐limited rather than N‐limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to elevated atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentrations by reducing leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity - patterns that correspond with increased net photosynthesis rates, total leaf area, and total biomass. Nitrogen supply has been hypothesized to be the primary factor controlling these responses, as nitrogen availability limits net primary productivity globally. Recent work using evo-evolutionary optimality theory suggests that leaf photosynthetic responses to elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ are independent of nitrogen supply and are instead driven by leaf nitrogen demand to build and maintain photosynthetic enzymes, which optimizes resource allocation to photosynthetic capacity and maximizes allocation to growth. Here, \textit{Glycine max} L. (Merr) seedlings were grown under two CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentrations, with and without inoculation with \textit{Bradyrhizobium japonicum}, and across nine soil nitrogen fertilization treatments in a full-factorial growth chamber experiment to reconcile the role of nitrogen supply and demand on leaf and whole-plant responses to elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$. After seven weeks, elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ increased net photosynthesis rates despite reduced leaf nitrogen content and maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport for RuBP regeneration. Effects of elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ on net photosynthesis and indices of photosynthetic capacity were independent of nitrogen fertilization and inoculation. However, positive effects of elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ on total biomass and total leaf area were enhanced with increasing nitrogen fertilization due to increased nitrogen uptake and reduced carbon costs to acquire nitrogen. Whole-plant responses to elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ were not modified by inoculation across the nitrogen fertilization gradient, as plant investment in nitrogen fixation was similar between CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ treatments. These results indicate that leaf nitrogen demand to build and maintain photosynthetic enzymes drives leaf photosynthetic responses to elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$, while nitrogen supply regulates whole-plant responses. Our findings build on previous work suggesting that terrestrial biosphere models may improve simulations of photosynthetic processes under future novel environments by adopting optimality principles.},

Furthermore, we resolve an offset in the global carbon budget that is most plausibly attributed to the land use flux. This correction shifts the mean land use flux since 1900 across 20 published estimates down by 0.35 PgC year−1 to 1.04 ± 0.57 PgC year−1, which is within the range but at the low end of these estimates. We show that the atmospheric CO2 record can provide insights into the time history of the land use flux that may reduce uncertainty in this term and improve current understanding and projections of the global carbon cycle.},

This study presents the evaluation – focussing on gross primary production (GPP) – of a new version of the ORCHIDEE model that gathers the representation of the nitrogen cycle and of its interactions with the carbon cycle from the OCN model and the most recent developments from the ORCHIDEE trunk version.

 We quantify the model skills at 78 FLUXNET sites by simulating the observed mean seasonal cycle, daily mean flux variations, and annual mean average GPP flux for grasslands and forests. Accounting for carbon–nitrogen interactions does not substantially change the main skills of ORCHIDEE, except for the site-to-site annual mean GPP variations, for which the version with carbon–nitrogen interactions is in better agreement with observations. However, the simulated GPP response to idealised [CO2] enrichment simulations is highly sensitive to whether or not carbon–nitrogen interactions are accounted for. Doubling of the atmospheric [CO2] induces an increase in the GPP, but the site-averaged GPP response to a CO2 increase projected by the model version with carbon–nitrogen interactions is half of the increase projected by the version without carbon–nitrogen interactions. This model's differentiated response has important consequences for the transpiration rate, which is on average 50\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr−1 lower with the version with carbon–nitrogen interactions.

 Simulated annual GPP for northern, tropical and southern latitudes shows good agreement with the observation-based MTE-GPP (model tree ensemble gross primary production) product for present-day conditions. An attribution experiment making use of this new version of ORCHIDEE for the time period 1860–2016 suggests that global GPP has increased by 50\&thinsp;\%, the main driver being the enrichment of land in reactive nitrogen (through deposition and fertilisation), followed by the [CO2] increase.

 Based on our factorial experiment and sensitivity analysis, we conclude that if carbon–nitrogen interactions are accounted for, the functional responses of ORCHIDEE r4999 better agree with the current understanding of photosynthesis than when the carbon–nitrogen interactions are not accounted for and that carbon–nitrogen interactions are essential in understanding global terrestrial ecosystem productivity.},

We present an updated version that includes plant and soil N dynamics, analysing the implications of accounting for C–N interactions on predictions and performance of the model. Stand structural dynamics and allometric scaling of tree growth suggested by global databases of forest stand structure and development were well reproduced by the model in comparison to an earlier multi-model study. Accounting for N cycle dynamics improved the goodness of fit for broadleaved forests. N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates reduces productivity of cold-climate and dry-climate ecosystems relative to mesic temperate and tropical ecosystems. In a model experiment emulating free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) treatment for forests globally, N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates of colder soils reduces CO2 enhancement of net primary production (NPP) for boreal forests, while some temperate and tropical forests exhibit increased NPP enhancement. Under a business-as-usual future climate and emissions scenario, ecosystem C storage globally was projected to increase by ca. 10\%; additional N requirements to match this increasing ecosystem C were within the high N supply limit estimated on stoichiometric grounds in an earlier study. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C–N interactions in studies of global terrestrial N cycling, and as a basis for understanding mechanisms on local scales and in different regional contexts.},

	abstract = {The Community Atmosphere–Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) is a land surface model (LSM) that can be applied stand-alone and provides the land surface–atmosphere exchange within the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS). We describe new developments that extend the applicability of CABLE for regional and global carbon–climate simulations, accounting for vegetation responses to biophysical and anthropogenic forcings. A land use and land cover change module driven by gross land use transitions and wood harvest area was implemented, tailored to the needs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Novel aspects include the treatment of secondary woody vegetation, which benefits from a tight coupling between the land use module and the Population Orders Physiology (POP) module for woody demography and disturbance-mediated landscape heterogeneity. Land use transitions and harvest associated with secondary forest tiles modify the annually resolved patch age distribution within secondary vegetated tiles, in turn affecting biomass accumulation and turnover rates and hence the magnitude of the secondary forest sink. Additionally, we implemented a novel approach to constrain modelled GPP consistent with the coordination hypothesis and predicted by evolutionary theory, which suggests that electron-transport- and Rubisco-limited rates adjust seasonally and across biomes to be co-limiting. We show that the default prior assumption – common to CABLE and other LSMs – of a fixed ratio of electron transport to carboxylation capacity at standard temperature (Jmax,\&thinsp;0∕Vcmax,\&thinsp;0) is at odds with this hypothesis; we implement an alternative algorithm for dynamic optimisation of this ratio such that coordination is achieved as an outcome of fitness maximisation. The results have significant implications for the magnitude of the simulated CO2 fertilisation effect on photosynthesis in comparison to alternative estimates and observational proxies.

 These new developments enhance CABLE's capability for use within an Earth system model and in stand-alone applications to attribute trends and variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle to regions, processes and drivers. Model evaluation shows that the new model version satisfies several key observational constraints: (i) trend and interannual variations in the global land carbon sink, including sensitivities of interannual variations to global precipitation and temperature anomalies; (ii) centennial trends in global GPP; (iii) coordination of Rubisco-limited and electron-transport-limited photosynthesis; (iv) spatial distributions of global ET, GPP, biomass and soil carbon; and (v) age-dependent rates of biomass accumulation in boreal, temperate and tropical secondary forests.

 CABLE simulations agree with recent independent assessments of the global land–atmosphere flux partition that use a combination of atmospheric inversions and bottom-up constraints. In particular, there is agreement that the strong CO2-driven sink in the tropics is largely cancelled by net deforestation and forest degradation emissions, leaving the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics as the dominant contributor to the net land sink.},

	abstract = {Understanding future changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle is important for reliable projections of climate change and impacts on ecosystems. It is well known that nitrogen (N) could limit plants' response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and it is therefore important to include a representation of the N cycle in Earth system models. Here we present the implementation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) – the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). Two configurations are discussed – the first one (JULES-CN) has a bulk soil biogeochemical model and the second one is a development configuration that resolves the soil biogeochemistry with depth (JULES-CNlayer). In JULES the nitrogen (N) cycle is based on the existing carbon (C) cycle and represents all the key terrestrial N processes in a parsimonious way. Biological N fixation is dependent on net primary productivity, and N deposition is specified as an external input. Nitrogen leaves the vegetation and soil system via leaching and a bulk gas loss term. Nutrient limitation reduces carbon-use efficiency (CUE – ratio of net to gross primary productivity) and can slow soil decomposition. We show that ecosystem level N limitation of net primary productivity (quantified in the model by the ratio of the potential amount of C that can be allocated to growth and spreading of the vegetation compared with the actual amount achieved in its natural state) falls at the lower end of the observational estimates in forests (approximately 1.0 in the model compared with 1.01 to 1.38 in the observations). The model shows more N limitation in the tropical savanna and tundra biomes, consistent with the available observations. Simulated C and N pools and fluxes are comparable to the limited available observations and model-derived estimates. The introduction of an N cycle improves the representation of interannual variability of global net ecosystem exchange, which was more pronounced in the C-cycle-only versions of JULES (JULES-C) than shown in estimates from the Global Carbon Project. It also reduces the present-day CUE from a global mean value of 0.45 for JULES-C to 0.41 for JULES-CN and 0.40 for JULES-CNlayer, all of which fall within the observational range. The N cycle also alters the response of the C fluxes over the 20th century and limits the CO2 fertilisation effect, such that the simulated current-day land C sink is reduced by about 0.5 Pg C yr−1 compared to the version with no N limitation. JULES-CNlayer additionally improves the representation of soil biogeochemistry, including turnover times in the northern high latitudes. The inclusion of a prognostic land N scheme marks a step forward in functionality and realism for the JULES and UKESM models.},

	abstract = {A global primary productivity and phytogeography model is described. The model represents the biochemical processes of photosynthesis and the dependence of gas exchange on stomatal conductance, which in turn depends on temperature and soil moisture. Canopy conductance controls soil water loss by evapotranspiration. The assignment of nitrogen uptake to leaf layers is proportional to irradiance, and respiration and maximum assimilation rates depend on nitrogen uptake and temperature. Total nitrogen uptake is derived from soil carbon and nitrogen and depends on temperature. The long-term average annual carbon and hydrological budgets dictate canopy leaf area. Although observations constrain soil carbon and nitrogen, the distribution of vegetation types is not specified by an underlying map. Variables simulated by the model are compared to experimental results. These comparisons extend from biochemical processes to the whole canopy, and the comparisons are favorable for both current and elevated CO2 atmospheres. The model is used to simulate the global distributions of leaf area index and annual net primary productivity. These distributions are sufficiently realistic to demonstrate that the model is useful for analyzing vegetation responses to global environmental change.},

	abstract = {In the latest projections of future greenhouse gas emissions for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), few Earth System Models included the effect of nitrogen limitation, a key process limiting forest regrowth. Few included forest management (wood harvest). We estimate the impacts of nitrogen limitation on the CO2 emissions from land use and land use change (LULUC), including wood harvest, for the period 1900–2100. We use a land surface model that includes a fully coupled carbon and nitrogen cycle and accounts for forest regrowth processes following agricultural abandonment and wood harvest. Future projections are based on the four Representation Concentration Pathways used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and we account for uncertainty in future climate for each scenario based on ensembles of climate model outputs. Results show that excluding nitrogen limitation will underestimate global LULUC emissions by 34–52 PgC (20–30\%) during the 20th century (range across three different historical LULUC reconstructions) and by 128–187 PgC (90–150\%) during the 21st century (range across the four IPCC scenarios). The full range for estimated LULUC emissions during the 21st century including climate model uncertainty is 91 to 227 PgC (with nitrogen limitation included). The underestimation increases with time because (1) projected annual wood harvest rates from forests summed over the 21st century are 380–1080\% higher compared to those of the 20th century, resulting in more regrowing secondary forests; (2) nitrogen limitation reduces the CO2 fertilization effect on net primary production of regrowing secondary forests following wood harvest and agricultural abandonment; and (3) nitrogen limitation effect is aggravated by the gradual loss of soil nitrogen from LULUC disturbance. Our study implies that (1) nitrogen limitation of CO2 uptake is substantial and sensitive to nitrogen inputs; (2) if LULUC emissions are larger than previously estimated in studies without nitrogen limitation, then meeting the same climate mitigation target would require an equivalent additional reduction of fossil fuel emissions; (3) the effectiveness of land-based mitigation strategies will critically depend on the interactions between nutrient limitations and secondary forests resulting from LULUC; and (4) it is important for terrestrial biosphere models to consider nitrogen constraint in estimates of the strength of future land carbon uptake.},

	abstract = {AbstractDrought has been a concern in global and regional water, carbon, and energy cycles. From 1999 to 2011, northern China experienced a multiyear precipitation reduction that significantly decreased water availability as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Index and soil moisture measurements. In this study, a light use efficiency model (EC-LUE) and an ecosystem physiological model (IBIS) were used to characterize the impacts of long-term drought on terrestrial carbon fluxes in northern China. EC-LUE and IBIS models showed the reduction of averaged GPP of 0.09 and 0.05 Pg C yr−1 during 1999–2011 compared with 1982–1998. Based on the IBIS model, simulated ecosystem respiration experienced an insignificant decrease from 1999 to 2011. The multiyear precipitation reduction changed the regional carbon uptake of 0.011 Pg C yr−1 from 1982 to 1998 to a net source of 0.018 Pg C yr−1 from 1999 to 2011. Moreover, a pronounced decrease in maize yield in almost all provinces in the study region was found from 1999 to 2011 versus the average of yield from1978 to 2011. The largest maize yield reduction occurred in Beijing (2499 kg ha−1 yr−1), Jilin (2180 kg ha−1 yr−1), Tianjing (1923 kg ha−1 yr−1), and Heilongjiang (1791 kg ha−1 yr−1), and the maize yield anomaly was significantly correlated with the annual precipitation over the entire study area. Our results revealed that recent climate change, especially drought-induced water stress, is the dominant cause of the reduction in the terrestrial carbon sink over northern China.},

We review the main improvements since the year 2012, mainly added modules for wild fires, carbon leaching through soil and transport of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean, and land cover changes but also improved representation of photosynthesis, respiration, and plant functional types. This version of ISBA-CTRIP is fully described in terms of land carbon pools, fluxes, and their interactions. Results are compared with the previous version in an off-line mode forced by observed climate during the historical time period. The two simulations are presented to demonstrate the model performance compared to an ensemble of observed and observation-derived data sets for gross and net primary productivity, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration, above and below ground biomass, litter, and soil carbon pools. New developments specific to the new version such as burned area, fire emissions, carbon leaching, and land cover are also validated against observations. The results show clearly that the latest version of ISBA-CTRIP outperforms the former version and reproduces generally well the observed mean spatial patterns in carbon pools and fluxes, as well as the seasonal cycle of leaf area index. The trends of the global fluxes over the last 50 years agree with other global models and with available estimates. This comparison gives us confidence that the model represents the main processes involved in the terrestrial carbon cycle and can be used to explore future global change projections.},

Discussion 516 Acknowledgements 518 References 518 Summary Land ecosystems sequester on average about a quarter of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It has been proposed that nitrogen (N) availability will exert an increasingly limiting effect on plants’ ability to store additional carbon (C) under rising CO2, but these mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we review findings from elevated CO2 experiments using a plant economics framework, highlighting how ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the costs and benefits of plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and symbiotic N-fixing microbes. We found that N-acquisition efficiency is positively correlated with leaf-level photosynthetic capacity and plant growth, and negatively with soil C storage. Plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi and N-fixers may acquire N at a lower cost than plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, the additional growth in ectomycorrhizal plants is partly offset by decreases in soil C pools via priming. Collectively, our results indicate that predictive models aimed at quantifying C cycle feedbacks to global change may be improved by treating N as a resource that can be acquired by plants in exchange for energy, with different costs depending on plant interactions with microbial symbionts.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the stomatal conductance and nitrogen concentration ([N]) of foliage decline under CO2 enrichment, and that the percentage growth response to elevated CO2 is ampliﬁed under water limitation, but reduced under nitrogen limitation. We advance simple explanations for these responses based on an optimisation hypothesis applied to a simple model of the annual carbon--nitrogen--water economy of trees growing at a CO2-enrichment experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. The model is shown to have an optimum for leaf [N], stomatal conductance and leaf area index (LAI), where annual plant productivity is maximised. The optimisation is represented in terms of a trade-off between LAI and stomatal conductance, constrained by water supply, and between LAI and leaf [N], constrained by N supply. At elevated CO2 the optimum shifts to reduced stomatal conductance and leaf [N] and enhanced LAI. The model is applied to years with contrasting rainfall and N uptake. The predicted growth response to elevated CO2 is greatest in a dry, high-N year and is reduced in a wet, low-N year. The underlying physiological explanation for this contrast in the effects of water versus nitrogen limitation is that leaf photosynthesis is more sensitive to CO2 concentration ([CO2]) at lower stomatal conductance and is less sensitive to [CO2] at lower leaf [N].},

The results from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments were summarized via meta-analysis to quantify the mean responses of stomatal and photosynthetic parameters to elevated [CO2]. Elevation of [CO2] in FACE experiments reduced stomatal conductance by 22\%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [CO2] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) in C3 plants grown in FACE by an average of 31\%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [CO2] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RubP)-limited at elevated [CO2]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [CO2], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [CO2] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [CO2].},

We decomposed the model responses into component processes affecting the response to eCO2 and confronted these with observations from the FACE experiments. Most of the models reproduced the observed initial enhancement of net primary production (NPP) at both sites, but none was able to simulate both the sustained 10-yr enhancement at Duke and the declining response at ORNL: models generally showed signs of progressive N limitation as a result of lower than observed plant N uptake. Nonetheless, many models showed qualitative agreement with observed component processes. The results suggest that improved representation of above-ground–below-ground interactions and better constraints on plant stoichiometry are important for a predictive understanding of eCO2 effects. Improved accuracy of soil organic matter inventories is pivotal to reduce uncertainty in the observed C–N budgets. The two FACE experiments are insufficient to fully constrain terrestrial responses to eCO2, given the complexity of factors leading to the observed diverging trends, and the consequential inability of the models to explain these trends. Nevertheless, the ecosystem models were able to capture important features of the experiments, lending some support to their projections.},

	abstract = {Large uncertainty exists in model projections of the land carbon (C) sink response to increasing atmospheric CO2. Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments lasting a decade or more have investigated ecosystem responses to a step change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. To interpret FACE results in the context of gradual increases in atmospheric CO2 over decades to centuries, we used a suite of seven models to simulate the Duke and Oak Ridge FACE experiments extended for 300 years of CO2 enrichment. We also determine key modeling assumptions that drive divergent projections of terrestrial C uptake and evaluate whether these assumptions can be constrained by experimental evidence. All models simulated increased terrestrial C pools resulting from CO2 enrichment, though there was substantial variability in quasi-equilibrium C sequestration and rates of change. In two of two models that assume that plant nitrogen (N) uptake is solely a function of soil N supply, the net primary production response to elevated CO2 became progressively N limited. In four of ﬁve models that assume that N uptake is a function of both soil N supply and plant N demand, elevated CO2 led to reduced ecosystem N losses and thus progressively relaxed nitrogen limitation. Many allocation assumptions resulted in increased wood allocation relative to leaves and roots which reduced the vegetation turnover rate and increased C sequestration. In addition, self-thinning assumptions had a substantial impact on C sequestration in two models. Accurate representation of N process dynamics (in particular N uptake), allocation, and forest self-thinning is key to minimizing uncertainty in projections of future C sequestration in response to elevated atmospheric CO2.},

Important lessons emerge by evaluating a set of hypotheses that initially guided the design and longevity of forested FACE experiments. Net primary productivity is increased by elevated CO2, but the response can diminish over time. Carbon accumulation is driven by the distribution of carbon among plant and soil components with differing turnover rates and by interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Plant community structure may change, but elevated CO2 has only minor effects on microbial community structure. FACE results provide a strong foundation for next-generation experiments in unexplored ecosystems and inform coupled climate-biogeochemical models of the ecological mechanisms controlling ecosystem response to the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

Our global study of 49 forests revealed an even more fundamental carbon allocation response to nutrient availability: forests with high-nutrient availability use 58 ± 3\% (mean ± SE; 17 forests) of their photosynthates for plant biomass production (BP), while forests with low-nutrient availability only convert 42 ± 2\% (mean ± SE; 19 forests) of annual photosynthates to biomass. This nutrient effect largely overshadows previously observed differences in carbon allocation patterns among climate zones, forest types and age classes. If forests with low-nutrient availability use 16 ± 4\% less of their photosynthates for plant growth, what are these used for? Current knowledge suggests that lower BP per unit photosynthesis in forests with low- versus forests with high-nutrient availability reﬂects not merely an increase in plant respiration, but likely results from reduced carbon allocation to unaccounted components of net primary production, particularly root symbionts.},

	abstract = {Crops of tomorrow are likely to grow under higher levels of atmospheric CO2. Fundamental crop growth processes will be affected and chief among these is carbon allocation. The root to shoot ratio (R:S, defined as dry weight of root biomass divided by dry weight of shoot biomass) depends upon the partitioning of photosynthate which may be influenced by environmental stimuli. Exposure of plant canopies to high CO2 concentration often stimulates the growth of both shoot and root, but the question remains whether elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration will affect roots and shoots of crop plants proportionally. Since elevated CO2 can induce changes in plant structure and function, there may be differences in allocation between root and shoot, at least under some conditions. The effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on carbon allocation has yet to be fully elucidated, especially in the context of changing resource availability. Herein we review root to shoot allocation as affected by increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and provide recommendations for further research. Review of the available literature shows substantial variation in R:S response for crop plants. In many cases (59.5\%) R:S increased, in a very few (3.0\%) remained unchanged, and in others (37.5\%) decreased. The explanation for these differences probably resides in crop type, resource supply, and other experimental factors. Efforts to understand allocation under CO2 enrichment will add substantially to the global change response data base.},

              , published online 24 April) report the results of a meta-analysis and modeling that show that increasing the concentration of atmospheric CO
              2
              also stimulates microbial decomposition of organic carbon in soils, by roughly the same amount that it increases soil organic carbon, leading to lower equilibrium soil carbon inventories and limiting the accumulation of carbon. Thus, soils may not provide as much carbon storage as hoped.

              Soils contain the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon (C) and are a major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
              2
              ). Thus, they may play a key role in modulating climate change. Rising atmospheric CO
              2
              is expected to stimulate plant growth and soil C input but may also alter microbial decomposition. The combined effect of these responses on long-term C storage is unclear. Combining meta-analysis with data assimilation, we show that atmospheric CO
              2
              enrichment stimulates both the input (+19.8\%) and the turnover of C in soil (+16.5\%). The increase in soil C turnover with rising CO
              2
              leads to lower equilibrium soil C stocks than expected from the rise in soil C input alone, indicating that it is a general mechanism limiting C accumulation in soil.},

However, extant plant trait distributions will not allow extrapolations to novel community assemblages in future climates, which will require a mechanistic understanding of the trade-offs that determine trait diversity. In this study, we show how physiological trade-offs involving leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf lifespan, leaf nitrogen, and leaf respiration may explain the distribution patterns of evergreen and deciduous trees in the temperate and boreal zones based on (1) an evolutionary analysis of a simple mathematical model and (2) simulation experiments of an individual-based dynamic vegetation model (i.e., LM3-PPA). The evolutionary analysis shows that these leaf traits set up a trade-off between carbon- and nitrogen-use efﬁciency at the scale of individual trees and therefore determine competitively dominant leaf strategies. As soil nitrogen availability increases, the dominant leaf strategy switches from one that is high in nitrogen-use efﬁciency to one that is high in carbon-use efﬁciency or, equivalently, from high-LMA/long-lived leaves (i.e., evergreen) to low-LMA/short-lived leaves (i.e., deciduous). In a region of intermediate soil nitrogen availability, the dominant leaf strategy may be either deciduous or evergreen depending on the initial conditions of plant trait abundance (i.e., founder controlled) due to feedbacks of leaf traits on soil nitrogen mineralization through litter quality. Simulated successional patterns by LM3-PPA from the leaf physiological trade-offs are consistent with observed successional dynamics of evergreen and deciduous forests at three sites spanning the temperate to boreal zones.},

These nutrients enter ecosystems via geologic and atmospheric pathways and are recycled to varying degrees through the plant–soil–microbe system via organic matter decay processes. However, the proportion of global NPP that can be attributed to new nutrient inputs versus recycled nutrients is unresolved, as are the large-scale patterns of variation across terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we combined satellite imagery, biogeochemical modeling, and empirical observations to identify previously unrecognized patterns of new versus recycled nutrient (N and P) productivity on land. Our analysis points to tropical forests as a hotspot of new NPP fueled by new N (accounting for 45\% of total new NPP globally), much higher than previous estimates from temperate and high-latitude regions. The large fraction of tropical forest NPP resulting from new N is driven by the high capacity for N fixation, although this varies considerably within this diverse biome; N deposition explains a much smaller proportion of new NPP. By contrast, the contribution of new N to primary productivity is lower outside the tropics, and worldwide, new P inputs are uniformly low relative to plant demands. These results imply that new N inputs have the greatest capacity to fuel additional NPP by terrestrial plants, whereas low P availability may ultimately constrain NPP across much of the terrestrial biosphere.},

Changes in patterns of tree growth can have a huge impact on atmospheric cycles, biogeochemical cycles, climate change, and biodiversity. Recent studies have shown increases in biomass across many forest types. This increase has been attributed to climate change. However, without knowing the disturbance history of a forest, growth could also be caused by normal recovery from unknown disturbances. Using a unique dataset of tree biomass collected over the past 22 years from 55 temperate forest plots with known land-use histories and stand ages ranging from 5 to 250 years, we found that recent biomass accumulation greatly exceeded the expected growth caused by natural recovery. We have also collected over 100 years of local weather measurements and 17 years of on-site atmospheric CO

Identifying this rate change is important to research on the current state of carbon stocks and the fluxes that influence how carbon moves between storage and the atmosphere. These results signal a pressing need to better understand the changes in growth rates in forest systems, which influence current and future states of the atmosphere and biosphere.},

	abstract = {Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered about half of the global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing about 15 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions1–3. Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades4,5. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests6. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature7–9. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.},

          , 
            Nitrogen availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that nitrogen enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that {\textasciitilde}19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26\%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.},

	abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is omnipresent in boreal forests, where it is assumed to benefit plant growth. However, experiments show inconsistent benefits for plants and volatility of individual partnerships, which calls for a re-evaluation of the presumed role of this symbiosis. We reconcile these inconsistencies by developing a model that demonstrates how mycorrhizal networking and market mechanisms shape the strategies of individual plants and fungi to promote symbiotic stability at the ecosystem level. The model predicts that plants switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines, in agreement with the frequency distribution of ectomycorrhizal colonization intensity across a wide-ranging data set. In line with observations in field-scale isotope labeling experiments, the model explains why ectomycorrhizal symbiosis does not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation. Instead, market mechanisms may generate self-stabilization of the mycorrhizal strategy via nitrogen depletion feedback, even if plant growth is ultimately reduced. We suggest that this feedback mechanism maintains the strong nitrogen limitation ubiquitous in boreal forests. The mechanism may also have the capacity to eliminate or even reverse the expected positive effect of rising CO2 on tree growth in strongly nitrogen-limited boreal forests.},

Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C–nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant–soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models.},

	abstract = {Nutrient cycling affects carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere and imposes controls on carbon cycle response to variation in temperature and precipitation, but nutrient cycling is ignored in most global coupled models of the carbon cycle and climate system. We demonstrate here that the inclusion of nutrient cycle dynamics, specifically the close coupling between carbon and nitrogen cycles, in a terrestrial biogeochemistry component of a global coupled climate system model leads to fundamentally altered behavior for several of the most critical feedback mechanisms operating between the land biosphere and the global climate system. Carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling reduces the simulated global terrestrial carbon uptake response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration by 74\%, relative to a carbon-only counterpart model. Global integrated responses of net land carbon exchange to variation in temperature and precipitation are significantly damped by carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling. The carbon cycle responses to temperature and precipitation variation are reduced in magnitude as atmospheric CO2 concentration rises for the coupled carbon-nitrogen model, but increase in magnitude for the carbon-only counterpart. Our results suggest that previous carbon-only treatments of climate-carbon cycle coupling likely overestimate the terrestrial biosphere's capacity to ameliorate atmospheric CO2 increases through direct fertilization. The next generation of coupled climate-biogeochemistry model projections for future atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change should include explicit, prognostic treatment of terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling.},

	abstract = {The representation of the nitrogen (N) cycle in Earth system models (ESMs) is strongly motivated by the constraint N poses on the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon (C). Models typically implement a stoichiometric relationship between C and N in which external supply and assimilation by organisms are adjusted to maintain their internal stoichiometry. N limitation of primary productivity thus occurs if the N supply from uptake and ﬁxation cannot keep up with the construction of tissues allowed by C assimilation. This basic approach, however, presents considerable challenges in how to faithfully represent N limitation. Here, we review how N limitation is currently implemented and evaluated in ESMs and highlight challenges and opportunities in their future development. At or near steady state, N limitation is governed by the magnitude of losses from the plant-unavailable pool vs. N ﬁxation and there are considerable differences in how models treat both processes. In nonsteady-state systems, the accumulation of N in pools with slow turnover rates reduces N available for plant uptake and can be challenging to represent when initializing ESM simulations. Transactional N limitation occurs when N is incorporated into various vegetation and soil pools and becomes available to plants only after it is mineralized, the dynamics of which depends on how ESMs represent decomposition processes in soils. Other challenges for ESMs emerge when considering seasonal to interannual climatic oscillations as they create asynchronies between C and N demand, leading to transient alternations between N surplus and deﬁcit. Proper evaluation of N dynamics in ESMs requires conceptual understanding of the main levers that trigger N limitation, and we highlight key measurements and observations that can help constrain these levers. Two of the biggest challenges are the mechanistic representation of plant controls on N availability and turnover, including N ﬁxation and organic matter decomposition processes.},

	abstract = {Projections of future changes in land carbon (C) storage using biogeochemical models depend on accurately modeling the interactions between the C and nitrogen (N) cycles. Here, we present a framework for analyzing N limitation in global biogeochemical models to explore how C-N interactions of current models compare to field observations, identify the processes causing model divergence, and identify future observation and experiment needs. We used a set of N-fertilization simulations from two global biogeochemical models (CLM-CN and O-CN) that use different approaches to modeling C-N interactions. On the global scale, net primary productivity (NPP) in the CLM-CN model was substantially more responsive to N fertilization than in the O-CN model. The most striking difference between the two models occurred for humid tropical forests, where the CLM-CN simulated a 62\% increase in NPP at high N addition levels (30 g N m−2 yr−1), while the O-CN predicted a 2\% decrease in NPP due to N fertilization increasing plant respiration more than photosynthesis. Across 35 temperate and boreal forest sites with field N-fertilization experiments, we show that the CLM-CN simulated a 46\% increase in aboveground NPP in response to N, which exceeded the observed increase of 25\%. In contrast, the O-CN only simulated a 6\% increase in aboveground NPP at the N-fertilization sites. Despite the small response of NPP to N fertilization, the O-CN model accurately simulated ecosystem retention of N and the fate of added N to vegetation when compared to empirical 15N tracer application studies. In contrast, the CLM-CN predicted lower total ecosystem N retention and partitioned more losses to volatilization than estimated from observed N budgets of small catchments. These results point to the need for model improvements in both models in order to enhance the accuracy with which global C-N cycle feedbacks are simulated.},

N availability strongly affects high-latitude foliage area and foliage N, limiting vegetation productivity and present-day high-latitude net C uptake. Anthropogenic N deposition is predicted to have increased net primary productivity due to increases in foliage area and foliage N, contributing 0.2–0.5 Pg C yr−1 to the 1990s global net C uptake. While O-CN's modeled global 1990s terrestrial net C uptake (2.4 Pg C yr−1) is similar to the estimate not accounting for anthropogenic N inputs and N dynamics (2.6 Pg C yr−1), its latitudinal distribution and the sensitivity of the terrestrial C balance to its driving factors are substantially altered by N dynamics, with important implications for future trajectories of the global carbon cycle.},

The results confirm some results from previous chamber experiments: light-saturated carbon uptake, diurnal C assimilation, growth and above-ground production increased, while specific leaf area and stomatal conductance decreased in elevated [CO2]. There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO2]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO2] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C4 species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco. The results from this review may provide the most plausible estimates of how plants in their native environments and field-grown crops will respond to rising atmospheric [CO2]; but even with FACE there are limitations, which are also discussed.

	abstract = {Plant responses to the projected future levels of CO2 were first characterized in short-term experiments lasting days to weeks. However, longer term acclimation responses to elevated CO2 were subsequently discovered to be very important in determining plant and ecosystem function. Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments are the culmination of efforts to assess the impact of elevated CO2 on plants over multiple seasons and, in the case of crops, over their entire lifetime. FACE has been used to expose vegetation to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 under completely open-air conditions for nearly two decades. This review describes some of the lessons learned from the long-term investment in these experiments. First, elevated CO2 stimulates photosynthetic carbon gain and net primary production over the long term despite down-regulation of Rubisco activity. Second, elevated CO2 improves nitrogen use efficiency and, third, decreases water use at both the leaf and canopy scale. Fourth, elevated CO2 stimulates dark respiration via a transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. Fifth, elevated CO2 does not directly stimulate C4 photosynthesis, but can indirectly stimulate carbon gain in times and places of drought. Finally, the stimulation of yield by elevated CO2 in crop species is much smaller than expected. While many of these lessons have been most clearly demonstrated in crop systems, all of the lessons have important implications for natural systems.},

	abstract = {Increased nutrient inputs due to anthropogenic activity are expected to increase primary productivity across terrestrial ecosystems, but changes in allocation aboveground versus belowground with nutrient addition have different implications for soil carbon (C) storage. Thus, given that roots are major contributors to soil C storage, understanding belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and biomass responses to changes in nutrient availability is essential to predicting carbon–climate feedbacks in the context of interacting global environmental changes. To address this knowledge gap, we tested whether a decade of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization consistently influenced aboveground and belowground biomass and productivity at nine grassland sites spanning a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions in the continental United States. Fertilization effects were strong aboveground, with both N and P addition stimulating aboveground biomass at nearly all sites (by 30\% and 36\%, respectively, on average). P addition consistently increased root production (by 15\% on average), whereas other belowground responses to fertilization were more variable, ranging from positive to negative across sites. Site-specific responses to P were not predicted by the measured covariates. Atmospheric N deposition mediated the effect of N fertilization on root biomass and turnover. Specifically, atmospheric N deposition was positively correlated with root turnover rates, and this relationship was amplified with N addition. Nitrogen addition increased root biomass at sites with low N deposition but decreased it at sites with high N deposition. Overall, these results suggest that the effects of nutrient supply on belowground plant properties are context dependent, particularly with regard to background N supply rates, demonstrating that site conditions must be considered when predicting how grassland ecosystems will respond to increased nutrient loading from anthropogenic activity.},

	abstract = {There may be trade-offs in the allocation patterns of recent photosynthetic carbon (RPC) allocation in response to environmental changes, with a greater proportion of RPC being directed towards compartments experiencing limited resource availability. Alternatively, the allocation of RPC could shift from sources to sinks as plants processing excess photosynthates. It prompts the question: Does the pattern of RPC allocation vary under global changes? If so, is this variation driven by optimal or by residual C allocation strategies? We conducted a meta-analysis by complicating 273 pairwise observations from 55 articles with 13C or 14C pulse or continuous labeling to assess the partitioning of RPC in biomass (leaf, stem, shoot, and root), soil pools (soil organic C, rhizosphere, and microbial biomass C) and CO2 fluxes under elevated CO2 (eCO2), warming, drought and nitrogen (N) addition. We propose that the increased allocation of RPC to belowground under sufficient CO2 results from the excretion of excess photosynthates. Warming led to a significant reduction in the percentage of RPC allocated to shoots, alongside an increase in roots allocation, although this was not statistically significant. This pattern is due to the reduced water availability resulting from warming. In conditions of drought, there was a notable increase in the partitioning of RPC to stems (+7.25\%) and roots (+36.38\%), indicative of a greater investment of RPC in roots for accessing water from deeper soil. Additionally, N addition led to a heightened allocation of RPC in leaves (+10.18\%) and shoots (+5.78\%), while reducing its partitioning in soil organic C (−8.92\%). Contrary to the residual C partitioning observed under eCO2, the alterations in RPC partitioning in response to warming, drought, and N supplementation are more comprehensively explained through the lens of optimal partitioning theory, showing a trade-off in the partitioning of RPC under global change.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 187–194 Abstract The degree to which rising atmospheric CO2 will be offset by carbon (C) sequestration in forests depends in part on the capacity of trees and soil microbes to make physiological adjustments that can alleviate resource limitation. Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO2 enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the rhizosphere. Over the course of 3 years, we measured in situ rates of root exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated with elevated CO2 (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates (μg C cm−1 root h−1) by 55\% during the primary growing season, leading to a 50\% annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R2 = 0.66; P = 0.006) in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO2 and N fertilization did not increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO2 in low fertility soils are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition has been a crucial topic in global change research, yet remains highly uncertain. One of the contributing factors to this uncertainty is the lack of understanding about the role of rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) in shaping the temperature sensitivity. Using a novel continuous 13C-labeling method, we investigated the temperature sensitivity of RPE and its impact on the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition. We observed an overall positive RPE. The SOM decomposition rates in the planted treatments increased 17–163\% above the unplanted treatments in three growth chamber experiments including two plant species, two growth stages, and two warming methods. More importantly, warming by 5 °C increased RPE up to threefold, hence, the overall temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition was consistently enhanced (Q10 values increased 0.3–0.9) by the presence of active rhizosphere. In addition, the proportional contribution of SOM decomposition to total soil respiration was increased by soil warming, implying a higher temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition than that of autotrophic respiration. Our results, for the first time, clearly demonstrated that root–soil interactions play a crucial role in shaping the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition. Caution is required for interpretation of any previously determined temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition that omitted rhizosphere effects using either soil incubation or field root-exclusion. More attention should be paid to RPE in future experimental and modeling studies of SOM decomposition.},

Mycorrhizal exudates and dead tissues contribute to the microbial necromass pool now known to play a dominant role in SOM formation and stabilization. While mycorrhizal fungi lack the genetic capacity to act as saprotrophs, they use several strategies to access nutrients locked in SOM and thereby promote its decay, including direct enzymatic breakdown, oxidation via Fenton chemistry, and stimulation of heterotrophic microorganisms through carbon provision to the rhizosphere. An additional mechanism, competition with free-living saprotrophs, potentially suppresses SOM decomposition, leading to its accumulation.

	abstract = {The connection between soil nitrogen availability, leaf nitrogen, and photosynthetic capacity is not perfectly understood. Because these three components tend to be positively related over large spatial scales, some posit that soil nitrogen positively drives leaf nitrogen, which positively drives photosynthetic capacity. Alternatively, others posit that photosynthetic capacity is primarily driven by above-ground conditions. Here, we examined the physiological responses of a non-nitrogen-fixing plant (Gossypium hirsutum) and a nitrogen-fixing plant (Glycine max) in a fully factorial combination of light by soil nitrogen availability to help reconcile these competing hypotheses. Soil nitrogen stimulated leaf nitrogen in both species, but the relative proportion of leaf nitrogen used for photosynthetic processes was reduced under elevated soil nitrogen in all light availability treatments due to greater increases in leaf nitrogen content than chlorophyll and leaf biochemical process rates. Leaf nitrogen content and biochemical process rates in G. hirsutum were more responsive to changes in soil nitrogen than those in G. max, probably due to strong G. max investments in root nodulation under low soil nitrogen. Nonetheless, whole-plant growth was significantly enhanced by increased soil nitrogen in both species. Light availability consistently increased relative leaf nitrogen allocation to leaf photosynthesis and whole-plant growth, a pattern that was similar between species. These results suggest that the leaf nitrogen–photosynthesis relationship varies under different soil nitrogen levels and that these species preferentially allocated more nitrogen to plant growth and non-photosynthetic leaf processes, rather than photosynthesis, as soil nitrogen increased.},

Although broad trade-offs among leaf structural and physiological traits have been demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive view of the fundamental constraints underlying the LES trade-offs. Here, we investigated physiological and structural mechanisms underpinning the LES by analysing a novel data compilation incorporating rarely considered traits such as the dry mass fraction in cell walls, nitrogen allocation, mesophyll CO2 diffusion and associated anatomical traits for hundreds of species covering major growth forms. The analysis demonstrates that cell wall constituents are major components of leaf dry mass (18–70\%), especially in leaves with high leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and long lifespan. A greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls is typically associated with a lower fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) invested in photosynthetic proteins; and lower within-leaf CO2 diffusion rates, as a result of thicker mesophyll cell walls. The costs associated with greater investments in cell walls underpin the LES: long leaf lifespans are achieved via higher LMA and in turn by higher cell wall mass fraction, but this inevitably reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition (15N/14N) of forested ecosystems varies systematically worldwide. In tropical forests, which are elevated in 15N relative to temperate biomes, a decrease in ecosystem 15N/14N with increasing rainfall has been reported. This trend is seen in a set of well characterized Hawaiian rainforests, across which we have measured the 15N/14N of inputs and hydrologic losses. We report that the two most widely purported mechanisms, an isotopic shift in N inputs or isotopic discrimination by leaching, fail to explain this climate-dependent trend in 15N/14N. Rather, isotopic discrimination by microbial denitrification appears to be the major determinant of N isotopic variations across differences in rainfall. In the driest climates, the 15N/14N of total dissolved outputs is higher than that of inputs, which can only be explained by a 14N-rich gas loss. In contrast, in the wettest climates, denitrification completely consumes nitrate in local soil environments, thus preventing the expression of its isotope effect at the ecosystem scale. Under these conditions, the 15N/14N of bulk soils and stream outputs decrease to converge on the low 15N/14N of N inputs. N isotope budgets that account for such local isotopic underexpression suggest that denitrification is responsible for a large fraction (24–53\%) of total ecosystem N loss across the sampled range in rainfall.},

To analyze whether amounts of mean annual rainfall (1240 mm year−1 in subhumid vs. 642 mm year−1 in semiarid forests) and rates of atmospheric N deposition affect the N cycle in TDF, we examined N concentrations in (i) green leaves, (ii) forest floor and mineral soil layers, and (iii) soil microbial biomass, as well as (iv) δ15N natural abundance in green leaves and (v) rates of soil enzyme activity and (vi) N losses in two sites (one subhumid and another semiarid) of Yucatan. The semiarid site had higher N concentrations in leaves and both soil layers than its subhumid counterpart. Natural abundance δ15N in the vegetation suggests a more open N cycle with lower rates of rainfall, which was corroborated by N losses as nitrous oxide (N2O) being twice as high in the semiarid compared to subhumid site. A more open N cycle subject to greater losses in response to N addition in the semiarid site, but not in the subhumid site, reinforce that rainfall amounts strongly affect N cycling in TDF.},

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 808 observations from 49 studies to test the effects of harvesting on the stocks and concentrations of soil C, N and P and C:N:P ratios relative to uncut control stands. With all harvesting intensities combined, C stock was unaffected by harvesting in either the forest floor or mineral soil, while harvesting reduced forest floor [C], [N] and [P] and C:N ratio, increased the mineral soil [C] and C:N ratio, but reduced mineral soil N stock. The impacts of harvesting on forest floor C and N stocks, C:P and N:P and mineral soil [C] and [N] changed from no effects by partial, stem-only and whole-tree harvesting (WTH) to significantly negative effects by the harvesting coupled with fire. Stem-only and WTH similarly reduced forest floor [P]. The negative effects of harvesting were most pronounced in conifer stands. Soil [C], [N] and C:N decreased with time since harvesting, but soil [P] did not, resulting in an increase in forest floor N:P. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the importance of harvest intensity and rotation length on long-term soil nutrient availability when managing forests. Furthermore, the lag in the recovery of phosphorus concentration following harvesting may indicate a decoupling of the phosphorus cycle from those of carbon and nitrogen, and a potential concern in managed forests.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the last decade available (2009–2018), EFF was 9.5±0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, ELUC 1.5±0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, GATM 4.9±0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (2.3±0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr−1), SOCEAN 2.5±0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, and SLAND 3.2±0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.4\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2018 alone, the growth in EFF was about 2.1\&thinsp;\% and fossil emissions increased to 10.0±0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, reaching 10\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 for the first time in history, ELUC was 1.5±0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5±0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (42.5±3.3\&thinsp;GtCO2). Also for 2018, GATM was 5.1±0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (2.4±0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.6±0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5±0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 407.38±0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the first 6–10 months indicate a reduced growth in EFF of +0.6\&thinsp;\% (range of −0.2\&thinsp;\% to 1.5\&thinsp;\%) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2018, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

	abstract = {The magnitude of the nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial carbon (C) storage over the 21st century is highly uncertain because of the complex interactions between the terrestrial C and N cycles. We use an ensemble approach to quantify and attribute process-level uncertainty in C-cycle projections by analysing a 30-member ensemble representing published alternative representations of key N cycle processes (stoichiometry, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and ecosystem N losses) within the framework of one terrestrial biosphere model. Despite large differences in the simulated present-day N cycle, primarily affecting simulated productivity north of 40°N, ensemble members generally conform with global C-cycle benchmarks for present-day conditions. Ensemble projections for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) show that the increase in land C storage due to CO2 fertilization is reduced by 24 ± 15\% due to N constraints, whereas terrestrial C losses associated with climate change are attenuated by 19 ± 20\%. As a result, N cycling reduces projected land C uptake for the years 2006–2099 by 19\% (37\% decrease to 3\% increase) for RCP 2.6, and by 21\% (40\% decrease to 9\% increase) for RCP 8.5. Most of the ensemble spread results from uncertainty in temperate and boreal forests, and is dominated by uncertainty in BNF (10\% decrease to 50\% increase for RCP 2.6, 5\% decrease to 100\% increase for RCP 8.5). However, choices about the flexibility of ecosystem C:N ratios and processes controlling ecosystem N losses regionally also play important roles. The findings of this study demonstrate clearly the need for an ensemble approach to quantify likely future terrestrial C–N cycle trajectories. Present-day C-cycle observations only weakly constrain the future ensemble spread, highlighting the need for better observational constraints on large-scale N cycling, and N cycle process responses to global change.},

The model was used to assess the influence of the allocation pattern on stand wood production, individual tree growth and nutrient cycling for even-aged conifer stands with adequate water, but suboptimal nitrogen.Stand wood production was maximized by quite low allocation to roots for specified amounts of plant-available nitrogen. However, the wood production of the individual was maximized by higher allocation to roots, because large root systems enhanced the ability of individuals to compete for nutrients. The optimal fine root allocation for a competing individual was less than 5\% of total production for adequate nitrogen, but rose to 30\% as nitrogen became more limiting, in general agreement with observed allocation patterns for fertilized versus non-fertilized forests.The high allocation to roots predicted for competitors may also enhance long-term productivity by decreasing nutrient losses from the ecosystem. Although collective, short-term stand wood production could be increased by shifting growth from roots to stems, this strategy may increase nutrient losses, ultimately decreasing productivity.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of nitrogen (N) limitation of forest carbon (C) sequestration at rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, the mechanisms responsible are not well understood. To elucidate the interactive effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) and soil N availability on forest productivity and C allocation, we hypothesized that (1) trees maximize fitness by allocating N and C to maximize their net growth and (2) that N uptake is controlled by soil N availability and root exploration for soil N. We tested this model using data collected in Free-Air CO2 Enrichment sites dominated by evergreen (Pinus taeda; Duke Forest) and deciduous [Liquidambar styraciflua; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)] trees. The model explained 80–95\% of variation in productivity and N-uptake data among eCO2, N fertilization and control treatments over 6 years. The model explains why fine-root production increased, and why N uptake increased despite reduced soil N availability under eCO2 at ORNL and Duke. In agreement with observations at other sites, the model predicts that soil N availability reduced below a critical level diminishes all eCO2 responses. At Duke, a negative feedback between reduced soil N availability and N uptake prevented progressive reduction in soil N availability at eCO2. At ORNL, soil N availability progressively decreased because it did not trigger reductions in N uptake; N uptake was maintained at ORNL through a large increase in the production of fast turnover fine roots. This implies that species with fast root turnover could be more prone to progressive N limitation of carbon sequestration in woody biomass than species with slow root turnover, such as evergreens. However, longer term data are necessary for a thorough evaluation of this hypothesis. The success of the model suggests that the principle of maximization of net growth to control growth and allocation could serve as a basis for simplification and generalization of larger scale forest and ecosystem models, for example by removing the need to specify parameters for relative foliage/stem/root allocation.},

Previous studies have elaborated this optimum under exponential growth; work on closed canopies has focused on foliage only. Here, the optimal co-allocation of C and N to foliage, fine roots and live wood is examined in a closed forest stand. • Optimal co-allocation maximizes net primary productivity (NPP) as constrained by stand-level C and N balances and the pipe model. Photosynthesis and maintenance respiration increase with foliar nitrogen concentration ([N]), and stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake saturate at high foliage and fine-root density. • Optimal NPP increases almost linearly from low to moderate N availability, saturating at high N. Where N availability is very low or very high, the system resembles a functional balance with a steady foliage [N]; in between, [N] increases with N availability. Carbon allocation to fine roots decreases, allocation to wood increases, and allocation to foliage remains stable with increasing N availability. • The predicted relationships between biomass density and foliage [N] are in reasonable agreement with data from coniferous stands across Finland.

However, the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose SOM and the mechanism by which they do so remain unclear, considering that they have lost many genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that are present in their saprotrophic ancestors. Spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling were used to examine the mechanisms by which five species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing at least four origins of symbiosis, decompose SOM extracted from forest soils. In the presence of glucose and when acquiring nitrogen, all species converted the organic matter in the SOM extract using oxidative mechanisms. The transcriptome expressed during oxidative decomposition has diverged over evolutionary time. Each species expressed a different set of transcripts encoding proteins associated with oxidation of lignocellulose by saprotrophic fungi. The decomposition ‘toolbox’ has diverged through differences in the regulation of orthologous genes, the formation of new genes by gene duplications, and the recruitment of genes from diverse but functionally similar enzyme families. The capacity to oxidize SOM appears to be common among ectomycorrhizal fungi. We propose that the ancestral decay mechanisms used primarily to obtain carbon have been adapted in symbiosis to scavenge nutrients instead.},

Here, we review recent findings, which support the view that some ectomycorrhizal fungi have the capacity to oxidize organic matter, either by ‘brown-rot’ Fenton chemistry or using ‘white-rot’ peroxidases. We propose that ectomycorrhizal fungi benefit from organic matter decomposition primarily through increased nitrogen mobilization rather than through release of metabolic C and question the view that ectomycorrhizal fungi may act as facultative saprotrophs.

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems remove about 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities each year1, yet the persistence of this carbon sink depends partly on how plant biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks respond to future increases in atmospheric CO2 (refs. 2,3). Although plant biomass often increases in elevated CO2 (eCO2) experiments4–6, SOC has been observed to increase, remain unchanged or even decline7. The mechanisms that drive this variation across experiments remain poorly understood, creating uncertainty in climate projections8,9. Here we synthesized data from 108 eCO2 experiments and found that the effect of eCO2 on SOC stocks is best explained by a negative relationship with plant biomass: when plant biomass is strongly stimulated by eCO2, SOC storage declines; conversely, when biomass is weakly stimulated, SOC storage increases. This trade-off appears to be related to plant nutrient acquisition, in which plants increase their biomass by mining the soil for nutrients, which decreases SOC storage. We found that, overall, SOC stocks increase with eCO2 in grasslands (8 ± 2 per cent) but not in forests (0 ± 2 per cent), even though plant biomass in grasslands increase less (9 ± 3 per cent) than in forests (23 ± 2 per cent). Ecosystem models do not reproduce this trade-off, which implies that projections of SOC may need to be revised.},

Here, we synthesise data from a field experiment in which three developing northern forest communities have been exposed to factorial combinations of elevated CO2 and O3. Enhanced net primary productivity (NPP) (c. 26\% increase) under elevated CO2 was sustained by greater root exploration of soil for growth-limiting N, as well as more rapid rates of litter decomposition and microbial N release during decay. Despite initial declines in forest productivity under elevated O3, compensatory growth of O3-tolerant individuals resulted in equivalent NPP under ambient and elevated O3. After a decade, NPP has remained enhanced under elevated CO2 and has recovered under elevated O3 by mechanisms that remain un-calibrated or not considered in coupled climate–biogeochemical models simulating interactions between the global C cycle and climate warming.},

	abstract = {Stimulation of terrestrial plant production by rising CO2 concentration is projected to reduce the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Coupled climate–carbon cycle models are sensitive to this negative feedback on atmospheric CO2, but model projections are uncertain because of the expectation that feedbacks through the nitrogen (N) cycle will reduce this so-called CO2 fertilization effect. We assessed whether N limitation caused a reduced stimulation of net primary productivity (NPP) by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration over 11 y in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in a deciduous Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand in Tennessee. During the first 6 y of the experiment, NPP was significantly enhanced in forest plots exposed to 550 ppm CO2 compared with NPP in plots in current ambient CO2, and this was a consistent and sustained response. However, the enhancement of NPP under elevated CO2 declined from 24\% in 2001–2003 to 9\% in 2008. Global analyses that assume a sustained CO2 fertilization effect are no longer supported by this FACE experiment. N budget analysis supports the premise that N availability was limiting to tree growth and declining over time —an expected consequence of stand development, which was exacerbated by elevated CO2. Leaf- and stand-level observations provide mechanistic evidence that declining N availability constrained the tree response to elevated CO2; these observations are consistent with stand-level model projections. This FACE experiment provides strong rationale and process understanding for incorporating N limitation and N feedback effects in ecosystem and global models used in climate change assessments.},

Utilizing 10 yr of data from the Duke free-air CO2 enrichment site, we evaluated the dynamics and distribution of plant C. • Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations, resulting in higher (up to 50\%) estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments. • Generally, elevated [CO2] caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C, but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools. Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its [CO2]-induced enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability, with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability. Consequently, [CO2]-induced net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30\% in different plots and years. • Through quantifying the effects of nutrient and water availability on the forest productivity response to elevated [CO2], we show that net primary productivity enhancement by elevated [CO2] is not uniform, but rather highly dependent on the availability of other growth resources.},

Several long-term CO2 enrichment experiments have measured changes in plant and soil pools and fluxes consistent with PNL but evidence for PNL in grasslands is limited. In an 11 year Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment on grazed grassland we found the amount of N harvested in aboveground plant biomass was greater at elevated CO2 but declined over time to be indistinguishable from ambient after 5 years. Re-wetting after a major drought resulted in a large input of N from mineralisation and a return to a higher N harvested under elevated CO2 followed by a further decline. Over these two periods the amount of N in soil significantly increased at elevated CO2. Data from mesocosms introduced into the rings at intervals, and therefore having different lengths of exposure to CO2, showed plant N availability declined at elevated CO2 reaching a new equilibrium after 6 years of exposure. We conclude that the availability of N for plants in this grassland is dynamic but the underlying trend at elevated CO2 is for PNL.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen (N) cycle has the potential to regulate climate change through its influence on carbon (C) sequestration. Although extensive research has explored whether or not progressive N limitation (PNL) occurs under CO2 enrichment, a comprehensive assessment of the processes that regulate PNL is still lacking. Here, we quantitatively synthesized the responses of all major processes and pools in the terrestrial N cycle with meta-analysis of CO2 experimental data available in the literature. The results showed that CO2 enrichment significantly increased N sequestration in the plant and litter pools but not in the soil pool, partially supporting one of the basic assumptions in the PNL hypothesis that elevated CO2 results in more N sequestered in organic pools. However, CO2 enrichment significantly increased the N influx via biological N fixation and the loss via N2O emission, but decreased the N efflux via leaching. In addition, no general diminished CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth was observed over time up to the longest experiment of 13 years. Overall, our analyses suggest that the extra N supply by the increased biological N fixation and decreased leaching may potentially alleviate PNL under elevated CO2 conditions in spite of the increases in plant N sequestration and N2O emission. Moreover, our syntheses indicate that CO2 enrichment increases soil ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3−) ratio. The changed NH4+/NO3− ratio and subsequent biological processes may result in changes in soil microenvironments, above-belowground community structures and associated interactions, which could potentially affect the terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. In addition, our data synthesis suggests that more long-term studies, especially in regions other than temperate ones, are needed for comprehensive assessments of the PNL hypothesis.},

	abstract = {If long-term responses of photosynthesis and leaf diffusive conductance to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are similar or predictably different among species, functional types, and ecosystem types, general global models of elevated CO2 effects can effectively be developed. To address this issue we measured gas exchange rates of 13 perennial grassland species from four functional groups across 11 years of long-term free-air CO2 enrichment (eCO2, +180 ppm above ambient CO2) in the BioCON experiment in Minnesota, USA. Eleven years of eCO2 produced consistent but modest increases in leaf net photosynthetic rates of 10\% on average compared with plants grown at ambient CO2 concentrations across the 13 species. This eCO2-induced enhancement did not depend on soil N treatment, is much less than the average across other longer-term studies, and represents strong acclimation (i.e. downregulation) as it is also much less than the instantaneous response to eCO2. The legume and C3 nonlegume forb species were the most responsive among the functional groups (+13\% in each), the C4 grasses the least responsive (+4\%), and C3 grasses intermediate in their photosynthetic response to eCO2 across years (+9\%). Leaf stomatal conductance and nitrogen content declined comparably across species in eCO2 compared with ambient CO2 and to degrees corresponding to results from other studies. The significant acclimation of photosynthesis is explained in part by those eCO2-induced decreases in leaf N content and stomatal conductance that reduce leaf photosynthetic capacity in plants grown under elevated compared with ambient CO2 concentrations. Results of this study, probably the longest-term with the most species, suggest that carbon cycle models that assume and thereby simulate long-lived strong eCO2 stimulation of photosynthesis (e.g.{\textgreater} 25\%) for all of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems should be viewed with a great deal of caution.},

Thus, it remains unclear how responses of leaf gas exchange to elevated CO2 (eCO2) vary among plant species and functional groups, or across different levels of nutrient supply, and whether they persist over time for long-lived perennials. Here, we report the effects of eCO2 on rates of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in 14 perennial grassland species from four functional groups over two decades in a Minnesota Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, BioCON. Monocultures of species belonging to C3 grasses, C4 grasses, forbs, and legumes were exposed to two levels of CO2 and nitrogen supply in factorial combinations over 21 years. eCO2 increased photosynthesis by 12.9\% on average in C3 species, substantially less than model predictions of instantaneous responses based on physiological theory and results of other studies, even those spanning multiple years. Acclimation of photosynthesis to eCO2 was observed beginning in the first year and did not strengthen through time. Yet, contrary to expectations, the response of photosynthesis to eCO2 was not enhanced by increased nitrogen supply. Differences in responses among herbaceous plant functional groups were modest, with legumes responding the most and C4 grasses the least as expected, but did not further diverge over time. Leaf-level water-use efficiency increased by 50\% under eCO2 primarily because of reduced stomatal conductance. Our results imply that enhanced nitrogen supply will not necessarily diminish photosynthetic acclimation to eCO2 in nitrogen-limited systems, and that significant and consistent declines in stomatal conductance and increases in water-use efficiency under eCO2 may allow plants to better withstand drought.},

In a 9-year experiment, N was added to monocultures of seven C3 grassland species exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 (560 μmol CO2 mol−1) to evaluate how N addition affects CO2 responsiveness in species of contrasting functional groups. Functional groups differed in their responses to elevated CO2 and N treatments. Forb species exhibited strong down-regulation of leaf Nmass concentrations (−26\%) and photosynthetic capacity (−28\%) in response to elevated CO2, especially at high N supply, whereas C3 grasses did not. Hence, achieved photosynthetic performance was markedly enhanced for C3 grasses (+68\%) in elevated CO2, but not significantly for forbs. Differences in access to soil resources between forbs and grasses may distinguish their responses to elevated CO2 and N addition. Forbs had lesser root biomass, a lower distribution of biomass to roots, and lower specific root length than grasses. Maintenance of leaf N, possibly through increased root foraging in this nutrient-poor grassland, was necessary to sustain stimulation of photosynthesis under long-term elevated CO2. Dilution of leaf N and associated photosynthetic down-regulation in forbs under elevated [CO2], relative to the C3 grasses, illustrates the potential for shifts in species composition and diversity in grassland ecosystems that have significant forb and grass components.},

	abstract = {Decades of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in the northeastern USA have enhanced this globally important forest carbon (C) sink by relieving N limitation. While many N fertilization experiments found increased forest C storage, the mechanisms driving this response at the ecosystem scale remain uncertain. Following the optimal allocation theory, augmented N availability may reduce belowground C investment by trees to roots and soil symbionts. To test this prediction and its implications on soil biogeochemistry, we constructed C and N budgets for a long-term, whole-watershed N fertilization study at the Fernow Experimental Forest, WV, USA. Nitrogen fertilization increased C storage by shifting C partitioning away from belowground components and towards aboveground woody biomass production. Fertilization also reduced the C cost of N acquisition, allowing for greater C sequestration in vegetation. Despite equal fine litter inputs, the C and N stocks and C : N ratio of the upper mineral soil were greater in the fertilized watershed, likely due to reduced decomposition of plant litter. By combining aboveground and belowground data at the watershed scale, this study demonstrates how plant C allocation responses to N additions may result in greater C storage in both vegetation and soil.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem carbon (C) balance is hypothesised to be sensitive to the mycorrhizal strategies that plants use to acquire nutrients. To test this idea, we coupled an optimality-based plant nitrogen (N) acquisition model with a microbe-focused soil organic matter (SOM) model. The model accurately predicted rhizosphere processes and C–N dynamics across a gradient of stands varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. When mycorrhizal dominance was switched – ECM trees dominating plots previously occupied by AM trees, and vice versa – legacy effects were apparent, with consequences for both C and N stocks in soil. Under elevated productivity, ECM trees enhanced decomposition more than AM trees via microbial priming of unprotected SOM. Collectively, our results show that ecosystem responses to global change may hinge on the balance between rhizosphere priming and SOM protection, and highlight the importance of dynamically linking plants and microbes in terrestrial biosphere models.},

Here we explore the large-scale distribution of N-fixing plant species worldwide. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We estimated root-symbiotic N-fixing plant species diversity (as Shannon entropy) and relative richness (log-ratio of N-fixing to non-fixing plant species) for c. 7,800 km2 hexagonal grid cells using the NodDB and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) databases. Additionally, we explored the distributions of plant species associated with rhizobia, actinobacteria or cyanobacteria (relative to other plant species), and the relative richness of N-fixing trees (log-ratio of N-fixing to non-fixing trees). We related N-fixing plant species distribution to environmental (climate, soil) and biogeographical (biome, realm) variables using multiple linear regression. Results N-fixing plant diversity and relative richness showed unimodal relationships with latitude. Diversity of N-fixing plants was highest in warm and wet climates, but in dry biomes and in Australasia. The relative richness of N-fixing plants was highest in warm and dry climates, in tropical and temperate grasslands and in Eurasia. Plants associated with cyanobacteria were more widely distributed near the equator, while those associated with rhizobia were more prevalent at the edge of the tropics, and those associated with actinobacteria at higher latitudes (especially in boreal forests). The relative richness of N-fixing tree species was highest in cold and dry areas and in boreal forests, with contrasting peaks in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Main conclusions The distribution of N-fixing plant species exhibits regional hotspots and coldspots related to both environmental conditions and biogeographical history. Global N-fixing plant distributions are different for the key root-symbiotic bacterial groups. Information about N-fixing plant distribution can improve global models of ecosystem functions and contribute to understanding how plants respond to global change.},

There is evidence that some N fixers fix N at the same rate regardless of environmental conditions (a strategy we call obligate), while others adjust N fixation to meet their needs (a strategy we call facultative). Although these strategies are likely to have qualitatively different impacts on their environment, the relative effectiveness and ecosystem‐level impacts of each strategy have not been explored. Using a simple mathematical model, we determine the best facultative strategy and show that it excludes any obligate strategy (fixer or nonfixer) in our basic model. To provide an explanation for the existence of nonfixers and obligate fixers, we show that both costs of being facultative and time lags inherent in the process of N fixation can select against facultative N fixers and also produce the seemingly paradoxical patterns of sustained N limitation and N richness. Finally, we speculate on why the costs and lags may differ between temperate and tropical regions and thus whether they can explain patterns in both biomes simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Symbiotic dinitrogen (N₂) fixation is often invoked to explain the N richness of tropical forests as ostensibly N₂-fixing trees can be a major component of the community. Such arguments assume N₂ fixers are fixing N when present. However, in laboratory experiments, legumes consistently reduce N₂ fixation in response to increased soil N availability. These contrasting views of N₂ fixation as either obligate or facultative have drastically different implications for the N cycle of tropical forests. We tested these models by directly measuring N₂-fixing root nodules and nitrogenase activity of individual canopydominant legume trees (Inga sp.) across several lowland forest types. Fixation was substantial in disturbed forests and some gaps but near zero in the high N soils of mature forest. Our findings suggest that canopy legumes closely regulate N₂ fixation, leading to large variations in N inputs across the landscape, and low symbiotic fixation in mature forests despite abundant legumes.},

	abstract = {Human activities have clearly caused dramatic alterations of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, and analyses of the extent and effects of such changes are now common in the scientific literature. However, any attempt to evaluate N cycling processes within ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic influences on the N cyclc, requires an understanding of the magnitude of inputs via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Although there have been many studies addressing the microbiology, physiology, and magnitude of N fixation at local scales, there are very few estimates of BNF over large scales. We utilized {\textgreater}10G preexisting published estimates of BNF to generate biome- And global-level estimates of biological N fixation. We also used net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from the Century terrestrial ecosystem model to examine global relationships between these variables and BNF as well as to compare observed and Century-modeled BNF. Our data-based estimates showed a strong positive relationship between ecosystem ET and BNF, and our analyses suggest that while the model's simple relationships for BNF predict broad scale patterns, they do not capture much of the variability or magnitude of published rates. Patterns of BNF were also similar to patterns of ecosystem NPP. Our best estimate of potential nitrogen fixation by natural ecosystems is -195 Tg N yr-1 with a range of 100-290 Tg N yr-1. Although these estimates do not account for the decrease in natural N fixation due to cultivation, this would not dramatically alter our estimate, as the greatest reductions in area have occurred in systems characterized by relatively low rates of N fixation (e.g., grasslands). Although our estimate of BNF in natural ecosystems is similar to previously published estimates of terrestrial BNF, we believe that this study provides a more documented, constrained estimate of this important flux.},

Nevertheless, determining rates and controls of BNF is crucial to placing anthropogenic changes to the N cycle in context, and to understanding, predicting and managing many aspects of global environmental change. Here, we estimate terrestrial BNF for a pre-industrial world by combining information on N fluxes with 15N relative abundance data for terrestrial ecosystems. Our estimate is that pre-industrial N fixation was 58 (range of 40–100) Tg N fixed yr−1; adding conservative assumptions for geological N reduces our best estimate to 44 Tg N yr−1. This approach yields substantially lower estimates than most recent calculations; it suggests that the magnitude of human alternation of the N cycle is substantially larger than has been assumed.},

Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs.

	abstract = {Biological nitrogen ﬁxation is a key contributor to sustaining the terrestrial carbon cycle, providing nitrogen input that plants require. However, the amount and global distribution of this ﬁxation is highly disputed. Using a comprehensive meta‐analysis of ﬁeld measurements, we make a new assessment of global biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF). We assessed the relationship between BNF in natural terrestrial environments and empirical predictors of BNF commonly used in terrestrial ecosystem and earth system models. We found no evidence for any statistically signiﬁcant relationship between BNF and evapotranspiration and net or gross primary terrestrial productivity. We assessed the relationship between BNF and 11 other climate variables and soil properties at a global scale. We found that all the variables we considered had little predictive power for BNF. Using averaged biome values upscaled we calculated the median global inputs of BNF in natural ecosystems as 88 Tg N year−1. The range (52–130 Tg N year−1) encompasses most recent estimates and broadly agrees with recent independent top‐down estimates of BNF. The global values indicate a signiﬁcant role for free living, as opposed to symbiotic, BNF, accounting for at least a third of all BNF. This work provides a new global benchmark and spatial distribution data set of BNF using a bottom‐up methodology.},

	abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing trees can provide large quantities of new N to ecosystems, but only if they are sufficiently abundant. The overall abundance and latitudinal abundance distributions of N-fixing trees are well characterised in the Americas, but less well outside the Americas. Here, we characterised the abundance of N-fixing trees in a network of forest plots spanning five continents, 5,000 tree species and 4 million trees. The majority of the plots (86\%) were in America or Asia. In addition, we examined whether the observed pattern of abundance of N-fixing trees was correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Outside the tropics, N-fixing trees were consistently rare in the forest plots we examined. Within the tropics, N-fixing trees were abundant in American but not Asian forest plots ( 7\% versus 1\% of basal area and stems). This disparity was not explained by mean annual temperature or precipitation. Our finding of low N-fixing tree abundance in the Asian tropics casts some doubt on recent high estimates of N fixation rates in this region, which do not account for disparities in N-fixing tree abundance between the Asian and American tropics. Synthesis. Inputs of nitrogen to forests depend on symbiotic nitrogen fixation, which is constrained by the abundance of N-fixing trees. By analysing a large dataset of 4 million trees, we found that N-fixing trees were consistently rare in the Asian tropics as well as across higher latitudes in Asia, America and Europe. The rarity of N-fixing trees in the Asian tropics compared with the American tropics might stem from lower intrinsic N limitation in Asian tropical forests, although direct support for any mechanism is lacking. The paucity of N-fixing trees throughout Asian forests suggests that N inputs to the Asian tropics might be lower than previously thought.},

	abstract = {In primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska, we tested the hypothesis that the major effect of initial nitrogen—fixing colonizers is to facilitate establishment of late—successional dominants and that other possible causes of successional change (e.g., life history factors governing seed rain and competitive interactions among species) need not be invoked. Environment changed dramatically through the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10—fold in the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture, total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through succession. Early—successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life—span, and shorter height at maturity than did mid—successional (alder, Alnus sinuata) and late—successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis). Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage, increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the 'black—crust') algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship). Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced germination and establishment in vegetated communities. Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages. Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent stages. The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative, alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage. Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter. In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at Glacier Bay.},

In this study, we determined leaf-associated N2 fixation of a range of rainforest plants in Costa Rica, under different environmental conditions, by tracing biomass N incorporation from 15N2. N2-fixing bacterial communities of the plant species Carludovica drudei, Grias cauliflora and Costus laevis were investigated in more detail by analysis of the nifH gene and leaf-associated bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis. N2 fixation rates varied among plant species, their growth sites (different microclimatic conditions) and light exposure. Leaf-associated diazotrophic bacterial communities detected on C. drudei and C. laevis were mainly composed of cyanobacteria (Nostoc spp.), whereas on the leaves of G. cauliflora γ-proteobacteria were dominant in addition to cyanobacteria. The complexity of diazotrophic communities on leaves was not correlated with N2 fixation activity. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis suggested the presence of complex microbial communities in association with leaves, however, cyanobacteria showed only low abundance. Our findings suggest that cyanobacteria as well as γ-proteobacteria associated with leaf-colonizing epiphytes may provide significant nitrogen input into this rainforest ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Including a terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle in Earth system models has led to substantial attenuation of predicted biosphere-climate feedbacks. However, the magnitude of this attenuation remains uncertain. A particularly important, but highly uncertain process is biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is the largest natural input of N to land ecosystems globally. In order to quantify this uncertainty, and estimate likely effects on terrestrial biosphere dynamics, we applied six alternative formulations of BNF spanning the range of process formulations in current state-of-the-art biosphere models within a common framework, the O-CN model: a global map of static BNF rates, two empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration), two process-oriented formulations based on plant N status, and an optimality-based approach. We examined the resulting differences in model predictions under ambient and elevated atmospheric [CO2] and found that the predicted global BNF rates and their spatial distribution for contemporary conditions were broadly comparable, ranging from 95 to 134 Tg N yr−1 (median 119 Tg N yr−1), despite distinct regional patterns associated with the assumptions of each approach. Notwithstanding, model responses in BNF rates to elevated levels of atmospheric [CO2] (+200 ppm) ranged between −4 Tg N yr−1 (−3 \%) and 56 Tg N yr−1 (+42 \%) (median 7 Tg N yr−1 (+8 \%)). As a consequence, future projections of global ecosystem carbon storage (+281 to +353 Pg C, or +13 to +16 \%), as well as N2O emission (−1.6 to +0.5 Tg N yr−1, or −19 to +7 \%) differed significantly across the different model formulations. Our results emphasize the importance of better understanding the nature and magnitude of BNF responses to change-induced perturbations, particularly through new empirical perturbation experiments and improved model representation.},

Our model is able to replicate the observed responses of net primary production to nutrient additions in N-limited, N- and P-colimited, and P-limited terrestrial environments. Our framework identifies a new pathway by which N2 fixers can alter P availability: By investing in N-rich, phosphorus liberation enzymes (phosphatases), fixers can greatly accelerate soil P availability and P cycling rates. This interaction is critical for the successful invasion and establishment of N2 fixers in an N-limited environment. We conclude that our model can be used to examine nutrient limitation broadly, and thus offers promise for coupling the biogeochemical system of C, N, and P to broader climate-system models.},

	abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation is the main source of new nitrogen into natural terrestrial ecosystems and consequently in the nitrogen cycle in many earth system models. Representation of biological nitrogen fixation varies, and because of the tight coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, previous studies have shown that this affects projected changes in net primary productivity. Here we present the first assessment of the performance of biological nitrogen fixation in models contributing to CMIP6 compared to observed and observation-constrained estimates of biological nitrogen fixation. We find that 9 out of 10 models represent global total biological nitrogen fixation within the uncertainty in recent global estimates. However, 6 out of 10 models overestimate the amount of fixation in the tropics and therefore the extent of the latitudinal gradient in the global distribution. For the SSP3-7.0 scenario of future climate change, models project increases in fixation over the 21st century of up to 80 \%. However, while the historical range of biological nitrogen fixation amongst models is large (up to 140 kg N ha−1 yr−1 at the grid cell level and 43–208 Tg N yr−1 globally) this does not have explanatory power for variations within the model ensemble of net primary productivity or the coupled nitrogen–carbon cycle. Models with shared structures can have significant variations in both biological nitrogen fixation and other parts of the nitrogen cycle without differing in their net primary productivity. This points to systematic challenges in the representation of carbon–nitrogen model structures and the severe limitations of models using net primary productivity or evapotranspiration to project the biological nitrogen fixation response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide or other environmental changes.},

The model is used to describe how photosynthesis and nutritional factors interact to determine the productivity of forests growing under nitrogen-limited conditions. A simulated instantaneous doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration leads to a growth response that is initially large (27\% above productivity at current CO2) but declines to {\textless} 10\% elevation within 5 yr. The decline occurs because increases in photosynthetic carbon gain at elevated CO2 are not matched by increases in nutrient supply. Lower foliar N concentrations at elevated CO2 have two countervailing effects on forest production: decreased rates of N cycling between vegetation and soils (with negative consequences for productivity), and reduced rates of N loss through gaseous emission, fire, and leaching. Theoretical analysis reveals that there is an enduring response to CO2 enrichment, but that the magnitude of the long-term equilibrium response is extremely sensitive to the assumed rate of gaseous emission resulting from mineralization of nitrogen.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems are shaped by the coupled cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and these cycles are strongly dependent on the availability of water and energy. These interactions shape future terrestrial biosphere responses to global change. Here, we present a new terrestrial ecosystem model, QUINCY (QUantifying Interactions between terrestrial Nutrient CYcles and the climate system), which has been designed from scratch to allow for a seamless integration of the fully coupled carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles with each other and also with processes affecting the energy and water balances in terrestrial ecosystems. This new model includes (i) a representation of plant growth which separates source (e.g. photosynthesis) and sink (growth rate of individual tissues, constrained by temperature and the availability of water and nutrients) processes; (ii) the acclimation of many ecophysiological processes to meteorological conditions and/or nutrient availability; (iii) an explicit representation of vertical soil processes to separate litter and soil organic matter dynamics; (iv) a range of new diagnostics (leaf chlorophyll content; 13C, 14C, and 15N isotope tracers) to allow for a more in-depth model evaluation. In this paper, we present the model structure and provide an assessment of its performance against a range of observations from global-scale ecosystem monitoring networks. We demonstrate that QUINCY v1.0 is capable of simulating ecosystem dynamics across a wide climate gradient, as well as across different plant functional types. We further provide an assessment of the sensitivity of key model predictions to the model's parameterisation. This work lays the ground for future studies to test individual process hypotheses using the QUINCY v1.0 framework in the light of ecosystem manipulation observations, as well as global applications to investigate the large-scale consequences of nutrient-cycle interactions for projections of terrestrial biosphere dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Competition is a major driver of carbon allocation to different
plant tissues (e.g., wood, leaves, fine roots), and allocation, in turn,
shapes vegetation structure. To improve their modeling of the terrestrial
carbon cycle, many Earth system models now incorporate vegetation
demographic models (VDMs) that explicitly simulate the processes of
individual-based competition for light and soil resources. Here, in order to
understand how these competition processes affect predictions of the
terrestrial carbon cycle, we simulate forest responses to elevated
atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] along a nitrogen availability
gradient, using a VDM that allows us to compare fixed allocation strategies
vs. competitively optimal allocation strategies. Our results show that
competitive and fixed strategies predict opposite fractional allocation to
fine roots and wood, though they predict similar changes in total net primary production (NPP) along
the nitrogen gradient. The competitively optimal allocation strategy
predicts decreasing fine root and increasing wood allocation with increasing
nitrogen, whereas the fixed strategy predicts the opposite. Although
simulated plant biomass at equilibrium increases with nitrogen due to
increases in photosynthesis for both allocation strategies, the increase in
biomass with nitrogen is much steeper for competitively optimal allocation
due to its increased allocation to wood. The qualitatively opposite
fractional allocation to fine roots and wood of the two strategies also
impacts the effects of elevated [CO2] on plant biomass. Whereas the
fixed allocation strategy predicts an increase in plant biomass under
elevated [CO2] that is approximately independent of nitrogen
availability, competition leads to higher plant biomass response to elevated
[CO2] with increasing nitrogen availability. Our results indicate that
the VDMs that explicitly include the effects of competition for light and
soil resources on allocation may generate significantly different
ecosystem-level predictions of carbon storage than those that use fixed
strategies.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial ecosystems of North America have been identified as a sink of atmospheric CO2 though there is no consensus on the magnitude. However, the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) may offset or even overturn the climate cooling effect induced by the CO2 sink. Using a coupled biogeochemical model, in this study, we have estimated the combined global warming potentials (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in North American terrestrial ecosystems and quantified the relative contributions of environmental factors to the GWP changes during 1979–2010. The uncertainty range for contemporary global warming potential has been quantified by synthesizing the existing estimates from inventory, forward modeling, and inverse modeling approaches. Our “best estimate” of net GWP for CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes was −0.50 ± 0.27 Pg CO2 eq/year (1 Pg = 1015 g) in North American terrestrial ecosystems during 2001–2010. The emissions of CH4 and N2O from terrestrial ecosystems had offset about two thirds (73 \%±14 \%) of the land CO2 sink in the North American continent, showing large differences across the three countries, with offset ratios of 57 \% ± 8 \% in US, 83 \% ± 17 \% in Canada and 329 \% ± 119 \% in Mexico. Climate change and elevated tropospheric ozone concentration have contributed the most to GWP increase, while elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration have contributed the most to GWP reduction. Extreme drought events over certain periods could result in a positive GWP. By integrating the existing estimates, we have found a wide range of uncertainty for the combined GWP. From both climate change science and policy perspectives, it is necessary to integrate ground and satellite observations with models for a more accurate accounting of these three greenhouse gases in North America.},

Four trait-scaling hypotheses (plant functional type, nutrient limitation, environmental filtering, and plant plasticity) with nine specific implementations were used to predict global Vcmax distributions and their impact on global GPP in the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM). Global GPP varied from 108.1 to 128.2 PgC yr−1, 65\% of the range of a recent model intercomparison of global GPP. The variation in GPP propagated through to a 27\% coefficient of variation in net biome productivity (NBP). All hypotheses produced global GPP that was highly correlated (r = 0.85–0.91) with three proxies of global GPP. Plant functional type-based nutrient limitation, underpinned by a core SDGVM hypothesis that plant nitrogen (N) status is inversely related to increasing costs of N acquisition with increasing soil carbon, adequately reproduced global GPP distributions. Further improvement could be achieved with accurate representation of water sensitivity and agriculture in SDGVM. Mismatch between environmental filtering (the most data-driven hypothesis) and GPP suggested that greater effort is needed understand Vcmax variation in the field, particularly in northern latitudes.},

	abstract = {The land biosphere, atmospheric chemistry and climate are intricately interconnected, yet the modeling of carbon–climate and chemistry–climate interactions have evolved as entirely separate research communities. We describe the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (YIBs) model version 1.0, a land carbon cycle model that has been developed for coupling to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE2 global chemistry–climate model. The YIBs model adapts routines from the mature TRIFFID (Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics) and CASA (Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach) models to simulate interactive carbon assimilation, allocation, and autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Dynamic daily leaf area index is simulated based on carbon allocation and temperature- and drought-dependent prognostic phenology. YIBs incorporates a semi-mechanistic ozone vegetation damage scheme. Here, we validate the present-day YIBs land carbon fluxes for three increasingly complex configurations: (i) offline local site level, (ii) offline global forced with WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim data) meteorology, and (iii) online coupled to the NASA ModelE2 (NASA ModelE2-YIBs). Offline YIBs has hourly and online YIBs has half-hourly temporal resolution. The large observational database used for validation includes carbon fluxes from 145 flux tower sites and multiple satellite products. At the site level, YIBs simulates reasonable seasonality (correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.8) of gross primary productivity (GPP) at 121 out of 145 sites with biases in magnitude ranging from −19 to 7 \% depending on plant functional type. On the global scale, the offline model simulates an annual GPP of 125 ± 3 Pg C and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of −2.5 ± 0.7 Pg C for 1982–2011, with seasonality and spatial distribution consistent with the satellite observations. We assess present-day global ozone vegetation damage using the offline YIBs configuration. Ozone damage reduces global GPP by 2–5 \% annually with regional extremes of 4–10 \% in east Asia. The online model simulates annual GPP of 123 ± 1 Pg C and NEE of −2.7 ± 0.7 Pg C. NASA ModelE2-YIBs is a useful new tool to investigate coupled interactions between the land carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change.},

Here, we build on a set of principles and hypotheses, funded in established theoretical understanding and supported by empirical evidence, to formulate and implement a dynamic model of carbon-nitrogen cycle (C-N) interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. The model combines a representation of photosynthetic acclimation to the atmospheric environment with implications for canopy and leaf N, a representation of functional balance for modelling C allocation and growth different tissues, and a representation of plant N uptake based on a first principles-informed, simplified description of solute transport in the soil. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of the model and its implementation and demonstrate the stability and functionality of the model for simulating seasonal variations of ecosystem C and N fluxes and pools. This may provide a way forward for representing key ecosystem processes related to C and N cycling based on established theoretical concepts with strong empirical support.},

	isbn = {978-0-87154-163-5},
	abstract = {In any meta-analysis, we start with summary data from each study and use it to compute an effect size for the study. An effect size is a number that reflects the magnitude of the relationship between two variables. For example, if a study reports the mean and standard deviation for the treated and control groups, we might compute the standardized mean difference between groups. Or, if a study reports events and nonevents in two groups we might compute an odds ratio. It is these effect sizes that are then compared and combined in the meta-analysis. Consider figure 12.1, the forest plot of a fictional meta-analysis to assess the impact of an intervention. In this plot, each study is represented by a square, bounded on either side by a confidence interval. The location of each square on the horizontal axis represents the effect size for that study. The confidence interval represents the precision with which the effect size has been estimated, and the size of each square is proportional to the weight that will be assigned to the study when computing the combined effect. This figure also serves as the outline for this chapter, in which I discuss what these items mean and how they are computed. This chapter addresses effect sizes for continuous outcomes such as means and correlations (for effect sizes for binary outcomes, see chapter 13, this volume).

  abstract = {Predicting if ecosystems will mitigate or exacerbate rising CO2 requires understanding how elevated CO2 will interact with coincident changes in diversity and nitrogen (N) availability to affect ecosystem carbon (C) storage. Yet achieving such understanding has been hampered by the difficulty of quantifying belowground C pools and fluxes. Thus, we used mass balance calculations to quantify the effects of diversity, CO2, and N on both the total amount of C allocated belowground by plants (total belowground C allocation, TBCA) and ecosystem C storage in a periodically burned, 8-year Minnesota grassland biodiversity, CO2, and N experiment (BioCON). Annual TBCA increased in response to elevated CO2, enriched N, and increasing diversity. TBCA was positively related to standing root biomass. After removing the influence of root biomass, the effect of elevated CO2 remained positive, suggesting additional drivers of TBCA apart from those that maintain high root biomass. Removing root biomass effects resulted in the effects of N and diversity becoming neutral or negative (depending on year), suggesting that the positive effects of diversity and N on TBCA were related to treatment-driven differences in root biomass. Greater litter production in high diversity, elevated CO2, and enhanced N treatments increased annual ecosystem C loss in fire years and C gain in non-fire years, resulting in overall neutral C storage rates. Our results suggest that frequently burned grasslands are unlikely to exhibit enhanced C sequestration with increasing atmospheric CO2 levels or N deposition.},

The objectives of this investigation were to characterize and quantify the temporal trends in soil mineral N and aboveground biomass N during the growing season of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with adequate N, ambient and elevated CO2, and two levels of water stress. The free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technique was used to enrich the air from 370 to 550 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 CO2. Spring wheat was planted in late December of 1992 and 1993 and harvested at the end of May. Each main plot (CO2 level) was split into two irrigation treatments to replace 100 and 50\% of the potential evapotranspiration. Soil and plant samples were taken for N analysis six times each year. Elevated CO2 lowered soil mineral N concentrations in the top 0.3 m of soil as much as 40\% and increased aboveground biomass N by as much as 16\% compared with the ambient treatment. Before anthesis, irrigation level had little effect on either soil mineral N or aboveground biomass N, but at harvest in 1992--1993 and at dough stage in 1993--1994 deficit-irrigated plots had higher soil mineral N (p {$<$} 0.05) and lower aboveground biomass N than plots that received adequate irrigation. There was little variation in the concentrations of N in the aboveground biomass among treatments within a sampling date. The data suggest elevated CO2 may lead to rapid N uptake, which could result in increased early vegetative growth.},

Dual choice feeding assays were performed with foliage from birch (               Betula papyrifera               Marsh.) and aspen (               Populus tremuloides               Michx., genotypes 216 and 259). Trees were grown at the Aspen Free Air CO               2               Enrichment (FACE) facility near Rhinelander, WI, USA, and had been exposed to ambient or elevated concentrations of CO               2               and/or O               3               . Levels of nutritional and secondary compounds were quantified through phytochemical analyses. The results showed that elevated O               3               levels increased FTC larval preferences for birch compared with aspen, whereas elevated CO               2               levels had the opposite effect. In assays with the two aspen genotypes, addition of both CO               2               and O               3               caused a shift in feeding preferences from genotype 259 to genotype 216. Consumption was unaffected by experimental treatments in assays comparing aspen and birch, but were increased for larvae given high O               3               foliage in the aspen genotype assays. Elevated levels of CO               2               and O               3               altered tree phytochemistry, but did not explain shifts in feeding preferences. The results demonstrate that increased levels of CO               2               and O               3               can alter insect host plant preferences both between and within tree species. Also, consequences of altered host quality (e.g., compensatory consumption) may be buffered by partial host shifts in situations when alternative plant species are available. Environmentally induced changes in host plant preferences may have the potential to alter the distribution of herbivory across plant genotypes and species, as well as competitive interactions among them.},

  abstract = {The initial stimulation of photosynthesis observed on elevation of [CO2] in grasslands has been predicted to be a transient phenomenon constrained by the loss of photosynthetic capacity due to other limitations, notably nutrients and sinks for carbohydrates. Legumes might be expected partially to escape these feedbacks through symbiotic N2 fixation. The Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment at Eschikon, Switzerland, has been the longest running investigation of the effects of open-air elevation of [CO2] on vegetation. The prediction of a long-term loss of photosynthetic capacity was tested by analysing photosynthesis in Trifolium repens L. (cv. Milkanova) in the spring and autumn of the eighth, ninth and tenth years of treatment. A high and low N treatment also allowed a test of the significance of exogenous N-supply in maintaining a stimulation of photosynthetic capacity in the long-term. Prior work in this Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment has revealed that elevated [CO2] increased both vegetative and reproductive growth of T. repens independent of N treatment. It is shown here that the photosynthetic response of T. repens was also independent of N fertilization under both current ambient and elevated (600 {\textmu}mol mol--1) [CO2]. There was a strong effect of season on photosynthesis, with light-saturated rates (Asat) 37\% higher in spring than in autumn. Higher Asat in the spring was supported by higher maximum Rubisco carboxylation rates (Vc,max) and maximum rates of electron transport (Jmax) contributing to RuBP regeneration. Elevated [CO2] increased Asat by 37\% when averaged across all measurement periods and both N fertilization levels, and decreased stomatal conductance by 25\%. In spring, there was no effect of elevated [CO2] on photosynthetic capacity of leaves, but in autumn both Vc,max and Jmax were reduced by approximately 20\% in elevated [CO2]. The results show that acclimation of photosynthetic capacity can occur in a nitrogen-fixing species, in the field where there are no artificial restrictions on sink capacity. However, even with acclimation there was a highly significant increase in photosynthesis at elevated [CO2].},

Photosynthesis was reduced by drought in midsummer and increased by elevated CO{$_2$} throughout the growing season, whereas warming only stimulated photosynthesis early in the year. At the beginning and end of the growing season, a T {\texttimes} CO{$_2$} interaction synergistically stimulated plant carbon uptake in the combination of warming and elevated CO{$_2$}. At peak drought, the D {\texttimes} CO{$_2$} interaction antagonistically down-regulated photosynthesis, suggesting a limited ability of elevated CO{$_2$} to counteract the negative effect of drought. The response of photosynthesis in the full factorial combination (TDCO{$_2$}) could be explained by the main effect of experimental treatments (T, D, CO{$_2$}) and the two-factor interactions (D {\texttimes} CO{$_2$}, T {\texttimes} CO{$_2$}). The interactive responses in the experimental treatments including elevated CO{$_2$} seemed to be linked to the realized range of treatment variability, for example with negative effects following experimental drought or positive effects following the relatively higher impact of night-time warming during cold periods early and late in the year. Longer-term experiments are needed to evaluate whether photosynthetic down-regulation will dampen the stimulation of photosynthesis under prolonged exposure to elevated CO{$_2$}.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (Ca) has a direct and measurable effect on plant growth. However, it does not affect all plant species equally, which could lead to shifts in competitive dominance of species in ecosystems. We used a dynamic plant carbon--nitrogen model to systematically examine how species traits affect the long-term Ca responsiveness of C3 plants when growing as established monocultures in the field. The model was tested against responses of 7 C3 herbaceous species growing in a free-air Ca enrichment (FACE) experiment (BioCON) in Minnesota, USA. Model simulations showed that several species traits affected the Ca response strongly, giving rise to a number of testable hypotheses about interspecific differences in responsiveness to Ca. The largest responses to rising Ca were obtained for species with low carbon-use efficiency (net primary production: gross primary production ratio), low foliar carbon allocation, low stomatal conductance, low instantaneous photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and low specific leaf area. In general, our model predicted that, for established plants growing in resource-limited field conditions, species with slow growth rates would be most responsive to elevated Ca. This prediction was supported by data from the BioCON experiment. Our model also predicts that, for young plants growing in non-resource-limited conditions, species with high growth rates will be most responsive to elevated Ca. This difference in species ranking under different resource availabilities is largely explained by the indirect effects of Ca on leaf area. Leaf-area feedbacks favour fast-growing species the most during leaf-area expansion, but following stand maturation they favour slow-growing species the most. These results imply that species that respond strongly to elevated Ca in short-term (non-resource-limited) glasshouse experiments are unlikely to also be the most responsive in resource-limited field conditions, and therefore that we cannot directly extrapolate from glasshouse experiments to predict which species will be most responsive to elevated Ca in the long term.},

In both years under elevated CO               2               , leaves of the individual species exhibited lower N concentrations and higher water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentrations. There was a significantly greater proportion of legume in the diet at elevated CO               2               but, together with the changes in chemical composition of individual species, this resulted in diets that had similar N but higher WSC and digestibility for both ambient and elevated CO               2               . We found that a greater proportion of dietary N was partitioned to urine at elevated CO               2               , probably because of the higher proportion of legume N in the diet, with possible differences in protein quality.

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine whether elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration modifies plant organic matter (OM) fluxes to the soil and whether any change in the fluxes can modify soil OM accumulation. Measurements were made in a grazed temperate grassland after almost 4~years exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 (475~{$\mu$}l~l-1) using a Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility located in the North Island of New Zealand. Aboveground herbage biomass and leaf litter production were not altered by elevated CO2 but root growth rate, as measured with the ingrowth core method, and root turnover were strongly stimulated by elevated CO2 particularly at low soil moisture contents during summer. Consequently, significantly more plant material was returned to the soil under elevated CO2 leading to an accumulation of coarse ({$>$} 1~mm) particulate organic matter (POM) but not of finer POM fractions. The accumulating POM exhibited a lower C/N ratio, which was attributed to the higher proportion of legumes in the pasture under elevated CO2. Only small changes were detected in the size and activity of the soil microbial biomass in response to the POM accumulation, suggesting that higher organic substrate availability did not stimulate microbial growth and activity despite the apparent lower C/N ratio of accumulating POM. As a result, elevated CO2 may well lead to an accumulation of OM in grazed grassland soil in the long term.},

In a field scale experiment on temperate heathland, manipulation of precipitation and temperature was performed with retractable curtains, and atmospheric CO2 concentration was increased by FACE. The combination of elevated CO2 and warming was expected to affect belowground processes additively, through increased belowground sequestration of labile carbohydrates due to elevated CO2 in combination with temperature increased process rates. Together, these changes might increase microbial activity and availability of plant nutrients. Two years after the start of the experiment, belowground processes responded significantly to the treatments. In the combined temperature and CO2 treatment the dissolved organic nitrogen concentration decreased and the ammonium concentration increased, but this release of nutrients was not mirrored by plant parameters. Microbial biomass carbon and microbial enrichment with 13C and 15N (1~year after 13C215N-glycine was injected into the soil) increased in warmed plots and in elevated CO2 plots, but not when these treatments were combined. Furthermore, drought led to an increase in Calluna biomass and total plant nitrogen pool. The full combination of warming, elevated CO2 and periodic drought did not unambiguously express the ecosystem responses of single factors additively, which complicates predictions of ecosystem responses to multifactor climate change.},

  abstract = {Soils constitute a major component of the global carbon cycle that will be affected by anthropogenic additions of CO2 to the atmosphere. As part of the Duke Forest Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment, we examined how forest growth at elevated (+200 ppmv) atmospheric CO2 concentration affects CO2 dynamics in the soil. Soil respiration and the concentration of CO2 in the soil pore space to a depth of 200 cm were measured over a 3-year period. Soil CO2 production was linked to soil acidification and mineral weathering by measuring changes in the composition of the soil solution, including alkalinity, Si, and major cations. The total flux of dissolved inorganic carbon to groundwater was then calculated from field measurements. The FACE fumigation gas contained a unique 13C signature that labeled newly fixed carbon, which was monitored in the soil system. As a result of CO2 enrichment, annual soil respiration increased by 27\% and was accompanied by higher CO2 concentrations in the soil pore space. These changes to soil CO2 dynamics were most likely the result of increased root and rhizosphere respiration, as suggested by the changes to the {$\delta$}13C of soil CO2. Increased soil CO2 under FACE accelerated the rates of soil acidification and mineral weathering. Thus an increase of 55\% in atmospheric CO2 concentration over 2 years resulted in a 271\% increase in soil solution cation concentration, a 162\% increase in alkalinity, and a 25\% increase in Si concentration at 200--cm depth. The flux of dissolved inorganic carbon to groundwater increased by 33\%, indicating a negative feedback to changes in atmospheric CO2 that could regulate the global carbon cycle over geological time.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization increased in response to elevated CO2, while ericoid mycorrhizal colonization was unchanged. The uptake of N and P was not increased proportionally with root growth after 5~years of treatment.ConclusionsWhile aboveground biomass was unchanged, the root growth was increased under elevated CO2. The results suggest that plant production may be limited by N (but not P) when exposed to elevated CO2. The species-specific response to the treatments suggests different sensitivity to global change factors, which could result in changed plant competitive interactions and belowground nutrient pool sizes in response to future climate change.},

We exposed a Danish heath ecosystem to elevated CO2, elevated temperature and extended summer drought alone and in all combinations in order to study whether the expected increased growth would be matched by an increase in root nutrient uptake of NH4+-N and NO3- -N. Root growth was significantly increased by elevated CO2. The roots, however, did not fully compensate for the higher growth with a similar increase in nitrogen uptake per unit of root mass. Hence the nitrogen concentration in roots was decreased in elevated CO2, whereas the biomass N pool was unchanged or even increased. The higher net root production in elevated CO2 might be a strategy for the plants to cope with increased nutrient demand leading to a long-term increase in N uptake on a whole-plant basis. Drought reduced grass root biomass and N uptake, especially when combined with warming, but CO2 was the most pronounced main factor effect. Several significant interactions of the treatments were found, which indicates that the responses were nonadditive and that changes to multiple environmental changes cannot be predicted from single-factor responses alone.},

  abstract = {Belowground plant responses have received much less attention in climate change experiments than aboveground plant responses, thus hampering a holistic understanding of climate change effects on plants and ecosystems. In addition, responses of plant roots to climate change have mostly been studied in single-factor experiments. In a Danish heathland ecosystem, we investigated both individual and combined effects of elevated CO2, warming and drought on fine root length, net production and standing biomass by the use of minirhizotrons, ingrowth cores and soil coring. Warming increased the net root production from ingrowth cores, but decreased fine root number and length in minirhizotrons, whereas there were no significant main effects of drought. Across all treatments and soil depths, CO2 stimulated both the total fine root length (+44\%) and the number of roots observed (+39\%), with highest relative increase in root length in the deeper soil layers. Our results suggest that under future climate, plants may allocate considerable resources into roots compared to aboveground biomass. Increased carbon (C) allocation to roots may have a great impact on the overall ecosystem C balance and must be considered in modelling of future ecosystem responses to climate change. To provide models with necessary validation data, more studies are needed to investigate if higher C allocation to roots will lead to long-term C storage in more recalcitrant soil C pools or if this potential increase in soil carbon storage may be offset by increased priming activity and turnover rates for soil organic matter.},

Increasing average temperatures by 1.7{$^\circ$}C observed over several seasons at Obregon, Mexico reduced the time to flowering by 11 days and resulted in a decline of total biomass and grain yield. These effects were reproduced by the model, except when the observed total biomass inexplicably rose again in the fourth and fifth year, despite higher temperature and a much shorter growing time. In a water stress experiment, the effects of different timing and duration of water deficit on crop growth and yield were reproduced with the model for a rain-shelter experiment at Lincoln, New Zealand where observed grain yields were reduced from 10 to 4tha-1 due to increased water deficit. In experiments from Western Australia, reduced growth and yields due to extreme terminal water deficit were also reproduced with the model where measured yields fall below 0.5tha-1. In the Maricopa Free Air Carbon-Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Arizona, USA, the largest yield increase occurred with elevated CO2 in the dry and high N treatments, whereas little or no response was observed in the wet and low N supply treatments, as simulated with the model. Combining elevated CO2 with increased temperature in a sensitivity analysis, two levels of water supply and a range of N applications indicated a positive effect of elevated CO2 on yield as long as N was not limiting growth. Increased temperature and reduced water supply reduced yields and the yield response to N supply under ambient and elevated CO2. Grain protein concentrations were reduced under elevated CO2, but the difference was minor with ample N fertiliser. Evapotranspiration was reduced under elevated CO2. Higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration with low N input, but reduced it with ample N fertiliser, resulting in a reduction and an increase, respectively, in drainage below the root zone. In the Mediterranean environment of Western Australia the impact of elevated CO2 and increased temperature on grain yield was in average positive, but varied with seasonal rainfall distribution. Based on the range of model testing experiments and the sensitivity analysis, APSIM-Nwheat was found suitable for studies on directional impacts of future climate change on wheat production. Due to some large discrepancies between simulated and observed data, field experiments representing only a limited range of possible climate change scenarios and the large possible range of factorial interactions not tested, simulated quantitative effects with the model should be interpreted cautiously.},

In a Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment at the Swiss alpine treeline (2180 m a.s.l.), the effects of elevated CO2 and previous year defoliation on needle quality of larch and the performance of the larch bud moth were investigated. 2. Starch and lignin concentrations increased and water content decreased in elevated CO2-grown needles compared with ambient CO2 concentration. Defoliation resulted in reduced N, water, starch, and sugar concentrations in needles of the next year generation. No interactions between elevated CO2 and defoliation on needle quality were observed. 3. Needle quality changes due to needle maturation over the course of the experiment, however, were much larger than the effects of elevated CO2 and defoliation. For example, N concentration was on average 38\% lower and lignin concentration 55\% higher at the end of the experiment (early July 2003) than at the beginning (mid June 2003). 4. On non-defoliated trees, larch bud moth larvae grew somewhat more slowly under elevated CO2 compared with ambient CO2 concentration. If, however, trees had been defoliated, this response was reversed, with a faster growth of larch bud moth on high CO2-exposed trees than on control trees. Pupal weight was not affected by either CO2 treatment or defoliation. 5. These results suggest that the larch bud moth has to cope with large changes in food quality due to needle maturation during its development, and that additional CO2- and defoliation-induced alterations in needle chemistry have comparatively minor influences on larch bud moth performance at the treeline.},

We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), GPP and Re under ambient and elevated [CO2] in a northern mixed-grass prairie (Wyoming, USA) during dry intervals and in response to simulated precipitation pulse events. Elevated [CO2] resulted in higher rates of both GPP and Re across the 2006 growing season, and the balance of these two fluxes (NEE) accounted for cumulative growing season C uptake (-14.4~{\textpm}~8.3~g~C~m-2). Despite lower GPP and Re, experimental plots under ambient [CO2] had greater cumulative uptake (-36.2~{\textpm}~8.2~g~C~m-2) than plots under elevated [CO2]. Non-irrigated control plots received 50\% of average precipitation during the drought of 2006, and had near-zero NEE (1.9~{\textpm}~6.4~g~C~m-2) for the growing season. Elevated [CO2] extended the magnitude and duration of pulse-related increases in GPP, resulting in a significant [CO2] treatment by pulse day interaction, demonstrating the potential for elevated [CO2] to increase the capacity of this ecosystem to respond to late-season precipitation. However, stimulation of Re throughout the growing season under elevated [CO2] reduced net C uptake compared to plots under ambient [CO2]. These results indicate that although elevated [CO2] stimulates gross rates of ecosystem C fluxes, it does not necessarily enhance net C uptake, and that C cycle responses in semi-arid grasslands are likely to be more sensitive to changes in precipitation than atmospheric [CO2].},

However, for trees these responses have primarily been studied in young expanding systems while the evidence for late successional systems that have reached steady state above- and below-ground is very limited. 2. At the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC) experimental site, we assessed whether elevated CO2 affects fine root biomass, fine root expansion and fine root C and N concentration under mature deciduous trees (c. 100 years) exposed to 7 years of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in a typical near-natural central European forest. 3. After 5 and 6 years of CO2 enrichment, both, the soil core and ingrowth core method yielded similar reductions in biomass of c. --30\% under elevated CO2 for live fine roots {$<$} 1 mm diameter. In year 7 of the experiment, when fine root biomass was re-assessed at peak season, there was no significant CO2-effect detectable. C and N concentrations in newly produced fine roots remained unaffected by elevated CO2. Soil moisture under CO2-exposed trees was significantly increased during rainless periods. 4. The isotopic label introduced into the system by canopy enrichment with 13C-depleted CO2 allowed us to trace the newly assimilated carbon. After 6 years of growth at 550 ppm CO2, recent fine roots ({$<$} 1 mm, ingrowth cores) of CO2-enriched trees consisted of 51\% new carbon, suggesting a rather slow root turnover and/or slow mixing of old and new carbon in these trees. 5. Reduced tree water consumption under elevated CO2 and resultant soil water savings might cause these trees to reduce their fine root investments in a future CO2-enriched atmosphere. 6. Our findings and those from other multi-year experiments indicate that fine root mass in late successional systems may also be unaffected or even suppressed instead of being stimulated by elevated CO2.},

  abstract = {There have been several simulation studies of the effects of increasing CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on crop productivity, but confidence in these would be substantially enhanced if the models used in the studies are shown to mimic the effects of increasing [CO2] and interactions with other variables such as nitrogen and water supplies. Since rice is one of the major staple crops in the world, it is highly desirable to evaluate the climate change impacts on this crop. In this study, we tested Oryza2000 model against the observed growth and yield of rice plants in a 3-year field experiment, where rice plants were subjected to elevated [CO2] with free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) under varying nitrogen (N) fertilization rates in farmers' rice paddies in northern Japan. The simulation results showed that the model greatly overestimates the increase in peak green leaf area index due to elevated [CO2], but that it simulates the enhancement of total plant biomass with only a minor overestimation. The model was successful in simulating the increase in rice yield due to the CO2 enrichment, but it failed to reproduce the observed interaction with N in the rice yield response to elevated [CO2].},

The planted cores were excavated from the ambient (35Pa pCO2) and enriched (60Pa pCO2) rings at two dates, in spring and autumn, during the growing season. The cores were brought back to the laboratory for 14C labelling of shoots in order to trace the transfer of recently assimilated C both within the plant and to the soil and microbial biomass. At the spring sampling, high N supply stimulated shoot and total dry matter production. Consistently, high N enhanced the allocation of recently fixed C to shoots, and reduced it to belowground compartments. Elevated CO2 had no consequences for DM or the pattern of C allocation. At the autumn sampling, at high N plot, yield of L. perenne was stimulated by elevated CO2. Consistently, 14C was preferentially allocated aboveground and, consequently belowground recent C allocation was depressed and rhizodeposition reduced. At both experimental periods, total soil C content was similar in all treatments, providing no evidence for soil carbon sequestration in the Swiss Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment (FACE) after 9 years of enrichment. Recently assimilated C and soil C were mineralised faster in soils from enriched rings, suggesting a CO2-induced shift in the microbial biomass characteristics (structure, diversity, activity) and/or in the quality of the root-released organic compounds.},

The effects of raised CO2 and increased atmospheric N deposition on growth of Sphagnum and other plants were studied in bogs at four sites across Western Europe. Contrary to expectations, elevated CO2 did not significantly affect Sphagnum biomass growth. Increased N deposition reduced Sphagnum mass growth, because it increased the cover of vascular plants and the tall moss Polytrichum strictum.

  abstract = {Down-regulation of light-saturated photosynthesis (A sat) at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2], has been demonstrated for many C3 species and is often associated with inability to utilize additional photosynthate and/or nitrogen limitation. In soybean, a nitrogen-fixing species, both limitations are less likely than in crops lacking an N-fixing symbiont. Prior studies have used controlled environment or field enclosures where the artificial environment can modify responses to [CO2]. A soybean free air [CO2] enrichment (FACE) facility has provided the first opportunity to analyze the effects of elevated [CO2] on photosynthesis under fully open-air conditions. Potential ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (V c,max) and electron transport through photosystem II (J max) were determined from the responses of A sat to intercellular [CO2] (C i) throughout two growing seasons. Mesophyll conductance to CO2 (g m) was determined from the responses of A sat and whole chain electron transport (J) to light. Elevated [CO2] increased A sat by 15-20\% even though there was a small, statistically significant, decrease in V c,max. This differs from previous studies in that V c,max/J max decreased, inferring a shift in resource investment away from Rubisco. This raised the C i at which the transition from Rubisco-limited to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration-limited photosynthesis occurred. The decrease in V c,max was not the result of a change in g m, which was unchanged by elevated [CO2]. This first analysis of limitations to soybean photosynthesis under fully open-air conditions reveals important differences to prior studies that have used enclosures to elevate [CO2], most significantly a smaller response of A sat and an apparent shift in resources away from Rubisco relative to capacity for electron transport.},

The atmosphere was enriched from 370 {$\mu$}mol CO2 mol-1 (control) to about 550 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 in free air during daylight hours. Under full irrigation, CO2 enrichment decreased stomatal conductance and single-leaf transpiration only toward the end of the season, and these changes led to increased leaf water potentials only at that time of year. Under water-stressed (deficit irrigation) conditions, CO2 enrichment decreased conductance throughout the season but there was no corresponding consistent effect on leaf water potentials. As with the fully irrigated controls, CO2 enrichment increased leaf water potentials only at the end of the season. CO2 enrichment increased season-long biomass accumulation 39\% under full irrigation and 34\% under deficit irrigation. These results are consistent with previous studies of cotton in open-top chambers that found only small effects of CO2 enrichment on internal water relations of cotton, and no water stress-induced increase in crop responsiveness to elevated CO2.},

Invasive plant responses to elevated CO2 and warming are difficult to predict, however, because of the many mechanisms involved, including modification of phenology, physiology, and cycling of nitrogen and water. Understanding the relative and interactive importance of these processes requires multifactor experiments under realistic field conditions. Here, we test how free-air CO2 enrichment (to 600 ppmv) and infrared warming (+1.5 {$^\circ$}C day/3 {$^\circ$}C night) influence a functionally and phenologically distinct invasive plant in semi-arid mixed-grass prairie. Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), a fast-growing Eurasian winter annual grass, increases fire frequency and reduces biological diversity across millions of hectares in western North America. Across 2 years, we found that warming more than tripled B. tectorum biomass and seed production, due to a combination of increased recruitment and increased growth. These results were observed with and without competition from native species, under wet and dry conditions (corresponding with tenfold differences in B. tectorum biomass), and despite the fact that warming reduced soil water. In contrast, elevated CO2 had little effect on B. tectorum invasion or soil water, while reducing soil and plant nitrogen (N). We conclude that (1) warming may expand B. tectorum's phenological niche, allowing it to more successfully colonize the extensive, invasion-resistant northern mixed-grass prairie, and (2) in ecosystems where elevated CO2 decreases N availability, CO2 may have limited effects on B. tectorum and other nitrophilic invasive species.},

  abstract = {Plant physiology is affected by climate change. Acclimations of photosynthetic processes are induced by short-term changes in climatic conditions. Further acclimation can be caused by longterm adjustments to climate change due to ecosystem-feedbacks. The aim of this PhD was to investigate plant physiological responses to climate change in a seasonal and long-term perspective. The effects of elevated CO2, passive night time warming and periodic summer drought as single factor and in combination, on plant physiology were investigated in the long-term multifactorial field experiment CLIMAITE in a Danish heathland (www.climaite.dk). The responses of plant physiological parameters, such as photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance and respiration were measured after six years of treatments.A small leaf adaptor frame was developed to conduct high precision leaf gas exchange measurement in the field (Paper I). The leaf adaptor frame increased the precision of the commonly used leaf gas exchange method. It was used to conduct all physiological measurements on the two dominated heathland species at the CLIMAITE-site, the grass Deschampsia flexuosaand the shrub Calluna vulgaris. In Calluna, differences in magnitude of physiological responses to the climate change treatment were found between warm and cold season. In the warm season no down-regulation of the photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO2 was found. Opposite significantly down-regulated photosynthetic capacity was observed during the cold season. However, in both seasons the stimulation of photosynthesis was maintained in elevated CO2. No effect of warming was found in either of the seasons, but drought was found to counterbalance the CO2-induced stimulation of photosynthesis during warm season (Paper II). Besides the study of seasonality, long term responses of plant physiology to the climate change factors were investigated. In the CLIMAITE-experiment it has been shown that 2 years of treatment altered physiological responses in Deschampsiaand Calluna. In the work of this PhD similar responses were observed after 6 years of treatment. The magnitudes of physiological responses were related to differences in soil water content in the respective years. Elevated CO2was the main driver for physiological changes in the two species with different growth strategies. The growth strategies of Deschampsia  and Calluna  defined the physiological responses to elevated CO2 and only severe drought was observed to change the magnitude of responses (Paper III).In conclusion, the leaf adaptor frame greatly improved the measurement precision of leaf gas exchange. High precision photosynthetic measurements showed that leaf level responses to climate change factors are stable upon a wide range of seasonal and inter-annual variation. Longterm ecosystem adjustments after 6 years of treatments did not cause further physiological acclimation in either Deschampsia or Calluna. The study indicates robustness of the Danish heathland ecosystem to moderate climate change.},

We investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on root biomass and N and P pools of a scrub-oak ecosystem on Merritt Island in Florida, USA, after 7~years of CO2 treatment. Roots were removed from 1-m deep soil cores in 10-cm increments, sorted into different categories ({$<$}0.25~mm, 0.25--1~mm, 1--2~mm, 2~mm to 1~cm, {$>$}1~cm, dead roots, and organic matter), weighed, and analyzed for N, P and C concentrations.

There was little effect on C, N, or P concentration or content with the exception of dead roots, and {$<$}0.25~mm and 1--2~mm diameter live roots at the surface. Thus, fine root mass and element content appear to be relatively insensitive to elevated CO2. In the top 10~cm of soil, biomass of roots with a diameter of {$<$}0.25~mm was depressed by elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 tended to decrease the mass and N content of dead roots compared to ambient CO2. A decreased N concentration of roots {$<$}0.25~mm and 1--2~mm in diameter under elevated CO2 may indicate reduced N supply in the elevated CO2 treatment. Our study indicated that elevated CO2 does not increase fine root biomass or the pool of C in fine roots.

  abstract = {Fine root biomass and C content are critical components in ecosystem C models, but they cannot be directly determined by minirhizotron techniques, and indirect methods involve estimating 3-dimensional values (biomass/ soil volume) from 2-dimensional measurements. To estimate biomass from minirhizotron data, a conversion factor for length to biomass must be developed, and assumptions regarding depth of view must be made. In a scrub-oak ecosystem in central Florida, USA, root length density (RLD) was monitored for 10years in a CO2 manipulation experiment using minirhizotron tubes. In the seventh year of the study, soil cores were removed from both ambient and elevated CO2 chambers. Roots from those cores were used to determine specific root length values (m/g) that were applied to the long-term RLD data for an estimation of root biomass over 10years of CO2 manipulation. Root length and biomass estimated from minirhizotron data were comparable to determinations from soil cores, suggesting that the minirhizotron biomass model is valid. Biomass estimates from minirhizotrons indicate the {$<$}0.25mm diameter roots accounted for nearly 95\% of the total root length in 2002. The long-term trends for this smallest size class ({$<$}0.25mm diameter) mirrored the RLD trends closely, particularly in relation to suspected root closure in this system. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect specific root length as determined by the soil cores. A significant treatment effect indicated smallest diameter fine roots ({$<$}0.25mm) were greater under elevated CO2 during the early years of the study and the largest (2--10mm) had greater biomass under elevated CO2 during the later years of the study. Overall, this method permits long-term analysis of the effects of elevated CO2 on fine root biomass accumulation and provides essential information for carbon models.},

  abstract = {In a FACE experiment, one year old alder, ash, beech, and oak seedlings were planted together in tubs containing calcareous sandy alluvial soil with or without a slow release NPK-fertilizer, and exposed to ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (360 and 600 {$\mu$}l mol-1) for 20 weeks. In addition to the fertilizer, all tubs received 15N-ammonium nitrate as a marker. Elevated CO2 significantly increased biomass production in alder, but had no effect on oak and ash. In beech, due to disease and mortality in all treatments, any possible effects were obscured. The addition of fertilizer had no effect on biomass production in alder, but increased production in oak and ash significantly. In oak a treatment synergism may be present. The non-appearance of a synergistic CO2 and fertilizer effect in alder may be explained by a fertilizer induced reduction of the N-fixing root-nodule biomass concurrent with a switch of the N-assimilation from atmospheric N to soil N supply, as the {$\delta$}15N measurements in the leaves of alder as opposed to oak indicate. Although elevated CO2 resulted in a significant biomass increase in alder, it did not lead to an appreaciable increase in the proportional presence of the species as measured on total plant biomass in the tub. Increasing the nutrient supply in the soil, however, did lead to appreciable gains in the proportional presence of oak and ash.},

  abstract = {Elevated CO2 and temperature strongly affect crop production, but understanding of the crop response to combined CO2 and temperature increases under field conditions is still limited while data are scarce. We grew wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) under two levels of CO2 (ambient and enriched up to 500 {$\mu$}mol mol(-1) ) and two levels of canopy temperature (ambient and increased by 1.5-2.0 {$^\circ$}C) in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) systems and carried out a detailed growth and yield component analysis during two growing seasons for both crops. An increase in CO2 resulted in higher grain yield, whereas an increase in temperature reduced grain yield, in both crops. An increase in CO2 was unable to compensate for the negative impact of an increase in temperature on biomass and yield of wheat and rice. Yields of wheat and rice were decreased by 10-12\% and 17-35\%, respectively, under the combination of elevated CO2 and temperature. The number of filled grains per unit area was the most important yield component accounting for the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature in wheat and rice. Our data showed complex treatment effects on the interplay between pre-heading duration, nitrogen uptake, tillering, leaf area index, and radiation use efficiency, and thus on yield components and yield. Nitrogen uptake before heading was crucial in minimising yield loss due to climate change in both crops. For rice, however, a breeding strategy to increase grain number per m(2) and \% filled grains (or to reduce spikelet sterility) induced by high temperature is also required to prevent yield reduction under conditions of global change.

Aboveground biomass allocation was unaffected, and belowground biomass also increased under elevated [CO2] conditions, by 22 to 38\%. Populus nigra, with total biomass equal to 62.02 and 72.03 Mg ha-1 in ambient and elevated [CO2], respectively, was the most productive species, although its productivity was stimulated least by atmospheric CO2 enrichment. There was greater depletion of inorganic nitrogen from the soil after three growing seasons in elevated [CO2], but no effect of [CO2] on stem wood density, which differed significantly only among species.},

Assimilation rates at CO2 partial pressure of 400 (A400) and 600 (A600) micromol mol(-1) were not significantly different under FACE treatment. Most notably FACE significantly decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)) both on upper and lower canopy leaves. N fertilization increased N content in the leaves on mass basis (Nm) and specific leaf area (SLA) in both CO2 treatments but did not influence the photosynthetic parameters.

In particular, isoprene oxidation leads to the formation of tropospheric ozone and other secondary pollutants. It is expected that changes in the composition of the atmosphere will influence the emission rate of isoprene, which may in turn feedback on the accumulation of pollutants and greenhouse gases. We investigated the isoprene synthase (ISPS) gene expression and the ISPS protein levels in aspen trees exposed to elevated ozone (O(3)) and/or elevated carbon dioxide (CO(2)) in field-grown trees at the Aspen Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experimental site. Elevated O(3) reduced ISPS mRNA and the amount of ISPS protein in aspen leaves, whereas elevated CO(2) had no significant effect. Aspen clones with different O(3) sensitivity showed different levels of inhibition under elevated O(3) conditions. The drop in ISPS protein levels induced a drop in the isoprene emission rate under elevated O(3). However, the data indicated that other mechanisms also contributed to the observed strong inhibition of isoprene emission under elevated O(3).},

  abstract = {Isoprene is the most important nonmethane hydrocarbon emitted by plants. The role of isoprene in the plant is not entirely understood but there is evidence that it might have a protective role against different oxidative stresses originating from heat shock and/or exposure to ozone (O(3)). Thus, plants under stress conditions might benefit by constitutively high or by higher stress-induced isoprene emission rates. In this study, measurements are presented of isoprene emission from aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees grown in the field for several years under elevated CO(2) and O(3). Two aspen clones were investigated: the O(3)-tolerant 271 and the O(3)-sensitive 42E. Isoprene emission decreased significantly both under elevated CO(2) and under elevated O(3) in the O(3)-sensitive clone, but only slightly in the O(3)-tolerant clone. This study demonstrates that long-term-adapted plants are not able to respond to O(3) stress by increasing their isoprene emission rates. However, O(3)-tolerant clones have the capacity to maintain higher amounts of isoprene emission. It is suggested that tolerance to O(3) is explained by a combination of different factors; while the reduction of O(3) uptake is likely to be the most important, the capacity to maintain higher amounts of isoprene is an important factor in strengthening this character.},

Though the influence of increasing atmospheric CO2 on net primary productivity, on the flow of newly fixed carbon belowground, and on the quality of new plant litter in ecosystems has been examined, indirect effects of increased CO2 on breakdown of large SOC pools already in ecosystems are not well understood. We found that exposure of California grassland communities to elevated CO2 retarded decomposition of older SOC when mineral nutrients were abundant, thus increasing the turnover time of SOC already in the system. Under elevated CO2, soil microorganisms appeared to shift from consuming older SOC to utilizing easily degraded rhizodeposits derived from increased root biomass. In contrast to this increased retention of stabilized older SOC under elevated CO2, movement of newly fixed carbon from roots to stabilized SOC pools was retarded; though root biomass increased under elevated CO2, new carbon in mineral-bound pools decreased. These contrasting effects of elevated CO2 on dynamics of old and new soil carbon pools contribute to a new soil carbon equilibrium that could profoundly affect long-term net carbon movement between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Future ecosystem properties of grasslands will be driven largely by belowground biomass responses to climate change, which are challenging to understand due to experimental and technical constraints. We used a multi-faceted approach to explore single and combined impacts of elevated CO2 and warming on root carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in a temperate, semiarid, native grassland at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment experiment. To investigate the indirect, moisture mediated effects of elevated CO2, we included an irrigation treatment. We assessed root standing mass, morphology, residence time and seasonal appearance/disappearance of community-aggregated roots, as well as mass and N losses during decomposition of two dominant grass species (a C3 and a C4). In contrast to what is common in mesic grasslands, greater root standing mass under elevated CO2 resulted from increased production, unmatched by disappearance. Elevated CO2 plus warming produced roots that were longer, thinner and had greater surface area, which, together with greater standing biomass, could potentially alter root function and dynamics. Decomposition increased under environmental conditions generated by elevated CO2, but not those generated by warming, likely due to soil desiccation with warming. Elevated CO2, particularly under warming, slowed N release from C4---but not C3---roots, and consequently could indirectly affect N availability through treatment effects on species composition. Elevated CO2 and warming effects on root morphology and decomposition could offset increased C inputs from greater root biomass, thereby limiting future net C accrual in this semiarid grassland.},

Methods Seedlings of typical subtropical forest ecosystems were transplanted in ten open-top chambers and grown under CO2 and nitrogen treatments. The treatments included: 1) elevated CO2 (700 {$\mu$}mol mol-1); 2) N addition of 100 kg NH4NO3 ha-1 yr-1; 3) combined elevated CO2 and N addition; and 4) control. We measured soil total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Results Results showed that elevated CO2 alone did not significantly affect soil TOC, POC and ROC after 4 years of treatment, but increased soil MBC and soil respiration compared to the control. N addition alone had no significant effect neither on soil TOC, POC and ROC, but decreased MBC and soil respiration over time. However, the elevated CO2 and N addition together significantly increased soil POC and ROC, and had no significant effect on soil MBC. Conclusions This study indicated that even in N-rich subtropical forest ecosystems, inputs of N are still needed in order to sustain soil C accumulation under elevated CO2.},

In the present study, 6N HCl hydrolysis and stable-carbon isotopic analysis ({$\delta$}13C) were used to investigate labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools and the translocation among these pools of sorghum residues isotopically labeled in the 1998--1999 Arizona Maricopa free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, in which elevated CO2 (FACE: 560{$\mu$}molmol-1) and ambient CO2 (Control: 360{$\mu$}molmol-1) interact with water-adequate (wet) and water-deficient (dry) treatments. We found that on average 53\% of the final soil organic carbon (SOC) in the FACE plot was in the recalcitrant carbon pool and 47\% in the labile pool, whereas in the Control plot 46\% and 54\% of carbon were in recalcitrant and labile pools, respectively, indicating that elevated CO2 transferred more SOC into the slow-decay carbon pool. Also, isotopic mixing models revealed that increased new sorghum residue input to the recalcitrant pool mainly accounts for this change, especially for the upper soil horizon (0--30cm) where new carbon in recalcitrant soil pools of FACE wet and dry treatments was 1.7 and 2.8 times as large as that in respective Control recalcitrant pools. Similarly, old C in the recalcitrant pool under elevated CO2 was higher than that under ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2 reduces the decay of the old C in recalcitrant pool. Mean residence time (MRT) of bulk soil carbon at the depth of 0--30cm was significantly longer in FACE plot than Control plot by the averages of 12 and 13yr under the dry and wet conditions, respectively. The MRT was positively correlated to the ratio of carbon content in the recalcitrant pool to total SOC and negatively correlated to the ratio of carbon content in the labile pool to total SOC. Influence of water alone on the bulk SOC or the labile and recalcitrant pools was not significant. However, water stress interacting with CO2 enhanced the shift of the carbon from labile pool to recalcitrant pool. Our results imply that terrestrial agroecosystems may play a critical role in sequestrating atmospheric CO2 and mitigating harmful CO2 under future atmospheric conditions.},

We examined the long-term effects of elevated [CO2] (ambient + 200 ppm CO2) on two age classes of needles in the upper and lower canopy of Pinus taeda L. during the second through sixth year of exposure to elevated [CO2] in free-air (free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)) in North Carolina, USA. Strong photosynthetic enhancement in response to elevated [CO2] (e.g., +60\% across age classes and canopy locations) was observed across the years. This stimulation was 33\% greater for current-year needles than for 1-year-old needles in the fifth and sixth years of treatment. Although photosynthetic stimulation in response to elevated [CO2] was maintained through the sixth year of exposure, we found evidence of concurrent down-regulation of Rubisco and electron transport capacity in the upper-canopy sunlit leaves. The lower canopy showed no evidence of down-regulation. The upper canopy down-regulated carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) and electron transport capacity (Jmax) by about 17-20\% in 1-year-old needles; however, this response was significant across sampling years only for Jmax in 1-year-old needles (P {$<$} 0.02). A reduction in leaf photosynthetic capacity in aging conifer needles at the canopy top could have important consequences for canopy carbon balance and global carbon sinks because 1-year-old sunlit needles contribute a major proportion of the annual carbon balance of these conifers. Our finding of a significant interaction between canopy position and CO2 treatment on the biochemical capacity for CO2 assimilation suggests that it is important to take canopy position and needle aging into account because morphologically and physiologically distinct leaves could respond differently to elevated [CO2].},

Functional groups differed in their responses to elevated CO               2               and N treatments. Forb species exhibited strong down-regulation of leaf               N               mass               concentrations (-26\%) and photosynthetic capacity (-28\%) in response to elevated CO               2               , especially at high N supply, whereas C               3               grasses did not. Hence, achieved photosynthetic performance was markedly enhanced for C               3               grasses (+68\%) in elevated CO               2               , but not significantly for forbs. Differences in access to soil resources between forbs and grasses may distinguish their responses to elevated CO               2               and N addition. Forbs had lesser root biomass, a lower distribution of biomass to roots, and lower specific root length than grasses. Maintenance of leaf N, possibly through increased root foraging in this nutrient-poor grassland, was necessary to sustain stimulation of photosynthesis under long-term elevated CO               2               . Dilution of leaf N and associated photosynthetic down-regulation in forbs under elevated [CO               2               ], relative to the C               3               grasses, illustrates the potential for shifts in species composition and diversity in grassland ecosystems that have significant forb and grass components.},

The CO2-unresponsive clone (216) partitions carbon into pathways associated with passive defense (e.g. lignin, phenylpropanoid) and cell wall thickening. {$\bullet$} This study indicates that there is significant variation in expression patterns between different tree genotypes in response to long-term exposure to e[CO2].

  abstract = {To understand the responses to external disturbance such as defoliation and possible feedback mechanisms at global change in terrestrial ecosystems, it is necessary to examine the extent and nature of effects on aboveground--belowground interactions. We studied a temperate heathland system subjected to experimental climate and atmospheric factors based on prognoses for year 2075 and further exposed to defoliation. By defoliating plants, we were able to study how global change modifies the interactions of the plant--soil system. Shoot production, root biomass, microbial biomass, and nematode abundance were assessed in the rhizosphere of manually defoliated patches of Deschampsia flexuosa in June in a full-factorial FACE experiment with the treatments: increased atmospheric CO2, increased nighttime temperatures, summer droughts, and all of their combinations. We found a negative effect of defoliation on microbial biomass that was not apparently affected by global change. The negative effect of defoliation cascades through to soil nematodes as dependent on CO2 and drought. At ambient CO2, drought and defoliation each reduced nematodes. In contrast, at elevated CO2, a combination of drought and defoliation was needed to reduce nematodes. We found positive effects of CO2 on root density and microbial biomass. Defoliation affected soil biota negatively, whereas elevated CO2 stimulated the plant--soil system. This effect seen in June is contrasted by the effects seen in September at the same site. Late season defoliation increased activity and biomass of soil biota and more so at elevated CO2. Based on soil biota responses, plants defoliated in active growth therefore conserve resources, whereas defoliation after termination of growth results in release of resources. This result challenges the idea that plants via exudation of organic carbon stimulate their rhizosphere biota when in apparent need of nutrients for growth.},

Aspen trees tolerated heat better than birch trees and elevated CO(2) protected photosynthesis of both species against moderate heat stress. Elevated CO(2) increased carboxylation capacity, photosynthetic electron transport capacity, and triose phosphate use in both birch and aspen trees. High temperature (36-39 degrees C) decreased all of these parameters in birch regardless of CO(2) treatment, but only photosynthetic electron transport and triose phosphate use at ambient CO(2) were reduced in aspen. Among the two aspen clones tested, 271 showed higher thermotolerance than 42E possibly because of the higher isoprene-emission, especially under elevated CO(2). Our results indicate that isoprene-emitting trees may have a competitive advantage over non-isoprene emitting ones as temperatures rise, indicating that biological diversity may be affected in some ecosystems because of heat tolerance mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the impacts of elevated CO2 in a treeline ecosystem in the Swiss Alps in a 9-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) study. We present new data and synthesize plant and soil results from the entire experimental period. Light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) of ca. 35-year-old Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata was stimulated by elevated CO2 throughout the experiment. Slight down-regulation of photosynthesis in Pinus was consistent with starch accumulation in needle tissue. Above-ground growth responses differed between tree species, with a 33~\% mean annual stimulation in Larix but no response in Pinus. Species-specific CO2 responses also occurred for abundant dwarf shrub species in the understorey, where Vaccinium myrtillus showed a sustained shoot growth enhancement (+11~\%) that was not apparent for Vaccinium gaultherioides or Empetrum hermaphroditum. Below ground, CO2 enrichment did not stimulate fine root or mycorrhizal mycelium growth, but increased CO2 effluxes from the soil (+24~\%) indicated that enhanced C assimilation was partially offset by greater respiratory losses. The dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration in soil solutions was consistently higher under elevated CO2 (+14~\%), suggesting accelerated soil organic matter turnover. CO2 enrichment hardly affected the C--N balance in plants and soil, with unaltered soil total or mineral N concentrations and little impact on plant leaf N concentration or the stable N isotope ratio. Sustained differences in plant species growth responses suggest future shifts in species composition with atmospheric change. Consistently increased C fixation, soil respiration and DOC production over 9~years of CO2 enrichment provide clear evidence for accelerated C cycling with no apparent consequences on the N cycle in this treeline ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Responses of alpine tree line ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming are poorly understood. We used an experiment at the Swiss tree line to investigate changes in vegetation biomass after 9 years of free air CO2 enrichment (+200 ppm; 2001--2009) and 6 years of soil warming (+4 {$^\circ$}C; 2007--2012). The study contained two key tree line species, Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata, both approximately 40 years old, growing in heath vegetation dominated by dwarf shrubs. In 2012, we harvested and measured biomass of all trees (including root systems), above-ground understorey vegetation and fine roots. Overall, soil warming had clearer effects on plant biomass than CO2 enrichment, and there were no interactive effects between treatments. Total plant biomass increased in warmed plots containing Pinus but not in those with Larix. This response was driven by changes in tree mass (+50\%), which contributed an average of 84\% (5.7 kg m-2) of total plant mass. Pinus coarse root mass was especially enhanced by warming (+100\%), yielding an increased root mass fraction. Elevated CO2 led to an increased relative growth rate of Larix stem basal area but no change in the final biomass of either tree species. Total understorey above-ground mass was not altered by soil warming or elevated CO2. However, Vaccinium myrtillus mass increased with both treatments, graminoid mass declined with warming, and forb and nonvascular plant (moss and lichen) mass decreased with both treatments. Fine roots showed a substantial reduction under soil warming (-40\% for all roots {$<$}2 mm in diameter at 0--20 cm soil depth) but no change with CO2 enrichment. Our findings suggest that enhanced overall productivity and shifts in biomass allocation will occur at the tree line, particularly with global warming. However, individual species and functional groups will respond differently to these environmental changes, with consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning.},

We report belowground plant responses of a scrub-oak ecosystem in Florida exposed to 11 yr of elevated atmospheric CO2 using open-top chambers. We measured fine root production, turnover and biomass using minirhizotrons, coarse root biomass using ground-penetrating radar and total root biomass using soil cores. Total root biomass was greater in elevated than in ambient plots, and the absolute difference was larger than the difference aboveground. Fine root biomass fluctuated by more than a factor of two, with no unidirectional temporal trend, whereas leaf biomass accumulated monotonically. Strong increases in fine root biomass with elevated CO2 occurred after fire and hurricane disturbance. Leaf biomass also exhibited stronger responses following hurricanes. Responses after fire and hurricanes suggest that disturbance promotes the growth responses of plants to elevated CO2. Increased resource availability associated with disturbance (nutrients, water, space) may facilitate greater responses of roots to elevated CO2. The disappearance of responses in fine roots suggests limits on the capacity of root systems to respond to CO2 enrichment.},

  abstract = {Global climate change in the real world always exhibits simultaneous changes in multiple factors. Prediction of ecosystem responses to multi-factor global changes in a future world strongly relies on our understanding of their interactions. However, it is still unclear how nitrogen (N) deposition and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] would interactively influence forest floor soil respiration in subtropical China. We assessed the main and interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and N addition on soil respiration by growing tree seedlings in ten large open-top chambers under CO2 (ambient CO2 and 700 \&mu;mol mol\&minus;1) and nitrogen (ambient and 100 kg N ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1) treatments. Soil respiration, soil temperature and soil moisture were measured for 30 months, as well as above-ground biomass, root biomass and soil organic matter (SOM). Results showed that soil respiration displayed strong seasonal patterns with higher values observed in the wet season (April--September) and lower values in the dry season (October--March) in all treatments. Significant exponential relationships between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures, as well as significant linear relationships between soil respiration rates and soil moistures (below 15\%) were found. Both CO2 and N treatments significantly affected soil respiration, and there was significant interaction between elevated [CO2] and N addition (p\&lt;0.001, p=0.003, and p=0.006, respectively). We also observed that the stimulatory effect of individual elevated [CO2] (about 29\% increased) was maintained throughout the experimental period. The positive effect of N addition was found only in 2006 (8.17\% increased), and then had been weakened over time. Their combined effect on soil respiration (about 50\% increased) was greater than the impact of either one alone. Mean value of annual soil respiration was 5.32 \&plusmn; 0.08, 4.54 \&plusmn; 0.10, 3.56 \&plusmn; 0.03 and 3.53 \&plusmn; 0.03 kg CO2 m\&minus;2 yr\&minus;1 in the chambers exposed to elevated [CO2] and high N deposition (CN), elevated [CO2] and ambient N deposition (CC), ambient [CO2] and high N deposition (NN), and ambient [CO2] and ambient N deposition (CK as a control), respectively. Greater above-ground biomass and root biomass was obtained in the CN, CC and NN treatments, and higher soil organic matter was observed only in the CN treatment. In conclusion, the combined effect of elevated [CO2] and N addition on soil respiration was apparent interaction. They should be evaluated in combination in subtropical forest ecosystems in China where the atmospheric CO2 and N deposition have been increasing simultaneously and remarkably.},

However, the effects of elevated CO2 and N deposition on soil respiration are not fully understood especially in subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China where ambient N deposition is high. In this study, we investigated the seasonal responses of soil respiration to elevated CO2 and N addition in young subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China using open-top chambers. Two CO2 treatment levels (i.e., ambient CO2 and 700{$\mu$}molmol-1) and two N levels (i.e., ambient and 100kgNha-1yr-1) were considered. Forty-eight 1--2 years old seedlings (eight seedlings per each of 6 species) were planted in each chamber. In the wet season, soil respiration significantly enhanced under elevated CO2 and N addition with no interactive effect. There was not significant relationship between treatment-enhanced soil respiration and soil moisture in the wet season, suggesting that increases in soil respiration resulted in large part from treatment-induced increases in tree growth and C inputs. In the dry season, soil respiration significantly enhanced under elevated CO2, but did not significantly change under N addition. The N-induced change in soil respiration negatively corrected with soil moisture in the dry season, indicating that decrease in soil moisture under N addition, together with increase in tree growth interactively resulted in negligible net change in soil respiration. Our results highlighted the seasonal importance of environmental controls under elevated CO2 and N deposition in the assessment of soil C sequestration potential in subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China.},

We conducted a field study using the New Zealand free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment to evaluate rhizospheric carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in a low-fertility species (Agrostis capillaris) and a high-fertility species (Lolium perenne) under 13 years of elevated CO2 and at ambient levels. Despite contrasting responses of plant growth, elevated CO2 significantly increased the total C and N (TC and TN, respectively), net N mineralization and nitrification rates (NMR and NR, respectively) as well as the {$\delta$}15N value of soil organic N in the rhizospheres across species. However, the rhizospheric microbial biomass C (MBC) was significantly enhanced for L. perenne but reduced for A. capillaris under elevated CO2, and was positively corrected with plant biomass. Elevated CO2 did not affect rhizospheric NO3--N concentrations for either species, while it significantly increased the rhizospheric NH4+-N concentration for A. capillaris. Together, the increased TC as well as the decreased MBC suggest rhizosphere in A. capillaris may be more favorable to long term C sequestration under elevated CO2. The increased NH4+-N concentration may stimulate the growth of A. capillaris under elevated CO2 in the near future, which will have significant implication for the change in species composition. The findings in this study are useful for parameterizing terrestrial biogeochemical models with mixed-species ecosystems, which can be used to analyze the effects of possible future climate change.},

By increasing the apparent quantum yield of photosynthesis (phi(c,max)), elevated [CO2] may increase maximum LAI. However, [O3] when elevated independently accelerates senescence and may reduce LAI. Large plots (20 m diameter) of soybean (Glycine max) were exposed to ambient (approx. 370 micromol mol(-1)) or elevated (approx. 550 micromol mol(-1)) CO2 or 1.2 times ambient [O3] using soybean free-air concentration enrichment (SoyFACE). In 2001 elevated CO2 had no detectable effect on maximum LAI, but in 2002 maximum LAI increased by 10\% relative to ambient air. Elevated [CO2] also increased the phi(c,max) of shade leaves in both years. Elevated [CO2] delayed LAI loss to senescence by approx. 54\% and also increased leaf-area duration. Elevated [O3] accelerated senescence, reducing LAI by 40\% near the end of the growing season. No effect of elevated [O3] on photosynthesis was detected. Elevated [CO2] or [O3] affected LAI primarily by altering the rate of senescence; knowledge of this may aid in optimizing future soybean productivity.},

In monocultures, CO               2               enrichment increased height, leaf area, above-ground biomass and reproductive output of cotton, but not sorghum, and was independent of soil water treatment. In mixtures, cotton, but not sorghum, above-ground biomass and height were generally reduced compared to monocultures, across both CO               2               and soil water treatments. Density did not affect individual plant responses of either cotton or sorghum across the other treatments. Total (cotton{$\quad$}               +               {$\quad$}sorghum) leaf area and above-ground biomass in low-density mixtures were similar between CO               2               treatments, but increased by 17--21\% with FACE in high-density mixtures, due to a 121\% enhancement of cotton leaf area and a 276\% increase in biomass under the FACE treatment. Total root biomass in the upper 1.2{$\quad$}m of the soil was not influenced by CO               2               or by soil water in monoculture or mixtures; however, under dry conditions we observed significantly more roots at lower soil depths (               {$>$}               {$\quad$}45{$\quad$}cm). Sorghum roots comprised 81--85\% of the total roots in the low-density mixture and 58--73\% in the high-density mixture. CO               2               -enrichment partly offset negative effects of interspecific competition on cotton in both low- and high-density mixtures by increasing above-ground biomass, with a greater relative increase in the high-density mixture. As a consequence, CO               2               -enrichment increased total above-ground yield of the mixture at high density. Individual plant responses to CO               2               enrichment in global change models that evaluate mixed plant communities should be adjusted to incorporate feedbacks for interspecific competition. Future field studies in natural ecosystems should address the role that a CO               2               -mediated increase in C               3               growth may have on subsequent vegetation change.},

  abstract = {The ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) can potentially alter litter decomposition rates by changing: (i) the litter quality of individual species, (ii) allocation patterns of individual species, (iii) the species composition of ecosystems (which could alter ecosystem-level litter quality and allocation), (iv) patterns of soil moisture, and (v) the composition and size of microbial communities. To determine the relative importance of these mechanisms in a California annual grassland, we created four mixtures of litter that differed in species composition (the annual legume Lotus wrangelianus Fischer \& C. Meyer comprised either 10\% or 40\% of the initial mass) and atmospheric [CO2] during growth (ambient or double-ambient). These mixtures decomposed for 33 weeks at three positions (above, on, and below the soil surface) in four types of grassland microcosms (fertilized and unfertilized microcosms exposed to elevated or ambient [CO2]) and at a common field site. Initially, legume-rich litter mixtures had higher nitrogen concentrations ([N]) than legume-poor mixtures. In most positions and environments, the different litter mixtures decomposed at approximately the same rate. Fertilization and CO2 enrichment of microcosms had no effect on mass loss of litter within them. However, mass loss was strongly related to litter position in both microcosms and the field. Nitrogen dynamics of litter were significantly related to the initial [N] of litter on the soil surface, but not in other positions. We conclude that changes in allocation patterns and species composition are likely to be the dominant mechanisms through which ecosystem-level decomposition rates respond to increasing atmospheric [CO2].},

At the same time, reactive nitrogen is entering natural systems at unprecedented rates. These global environmental changes have consequences for the functioning of natural ecosystems, and responses of these systems may feed back to affect climate and atmospheric composition. Here, we report plant growth responses of an ecosystem exposed to factorial combinations of four expected global environmental changes. We exposed California grassland to elevated CO2, temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition for five years. Root and shoot production did not respond to elevated CO2 or modest warming. Supplemental precipitation led to increases in shoot production and offsetting decreases in root production. Supplemental nitrate deposition increased total production by an average of 26\%, primarily by stimulating shoot growth. Interactions among the main treatments were rare. Together, these results suggest that production in this grassland will respond minimally to changes in CO2 and winter precipitation, and to small amounts of warming. Increased nitrate deposition would have stronger effects on the grassland. Aside from this nitrate response, expectations that a changing atmosphere and climate would promote carbon storage by increasing plant growth appear unlikely to be realized in this system.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 increase plant biomass, net primary production (NPP) and plant demand for nitrogen (N). The demand for N set by rapid plant growth under elevated CO2 could be met by increasing soil N availability or by greater efficiency of N uptake. Alternatively, plants could increase their nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), thereby maintaining high rates of growth and NPP in the face of nutrient limitation. We quantified dry matter and N budgets for a young pine forest exposed to 4~years of elevated CO2 using free-air CO2 enrichment technology. We addressed three questions: Does elevated CO2 increase forest NPP and the demand for N by vegetation? Is demand for N met by greater uptake from soils, a shift in the distribution of N between plants, microbes, and soils, or increases in NUE under elevated CO2? Will soil N availability constrain the NPP response of this forest as CO2 fumigation continues? A step-function increase in atmospheric CO2 significantly increased NPP during the first 4~years of this study. Significant increases in NUE under elevated CO2 modulated the average annual requirement for N by vegetation in the first and third growing seasons under elevated CO2; the average stimulation of NPP in these years was 21\% whereas the average annual stimulation of the N requirement was only 6\%. In the second and fourth growing seasons, increases in NPP increased the annual requirement for N by 27--33\%. Increases in the annual requirement for N were largely met by increases in N uptake from soils. Retranslocation of nutrients prior to senescence played only a minor role in supplying the additional N required by trees growing under elevated CO2. NPP was highly correlated with between-plot variation in the annual rate of net N mineralization and CO2 treatment. This demonstrates that NPP is co-limited by C availability, as CO2 from the atmosphere, and N availability from soils. There is no evidence that soil N mineralization rates have increased under elevated CO2. The correlation between NPP and N mineralization rates and the increase in the annual requirement for N in certain years imply that soil N availability may control the long-term productivity response of this ecosystem to elevated CO2. Although we have no evidence suggesting that NPP is declining in response to {$>$}4~years of CO2 fumigation, if the annual requirement of N continues to be stimulated by elevated CO2, we predict that the productivity response of this forest ecosystem will decline over time.},

  abstract = {A hypothesis for progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) proposes that net primary production (NPP) will decline through time in ecosystems subjected to a step-function increase in atmospheric CO2. The primary mechanism driving this response is a rapid rate of N immobilization by plants and microbes under elevated CO2 that depletes soils of N, causing slower rates of N mineralization. Under this hypothesis, there is little long-term stimulation of NPP by elevated CO2 in the absence of exogenous inputs of N. We tested this hypothesis using data on the pools and fluxes of C and N in tree biomass, microbes, and soils from 1997 through 2002 collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. Elevated CO2 stimulated NPP by 18-24\% during the first six years of this experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis for PNL, significantly more N was immobilized in tree biomass and in the O horizon under elevated CO2. In contrast to the PNL hypothesis, microbial-N immobilization did not increase under elevated CO2, and although the rate of net N mineralization declined through time, the decline was not significantly more rapid under elevated CO 2. Ecosystem C-to-N ratios widened more rapidly under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 indicating a more rapid rate of C fixation per unit of N, a processes that could delay PNL in this ecosystem. Mass balance calculations demonstrated a large accrual of ecosystem N capital. Is PNL occurring in this ecosystem and will NPP decline to levels under ambient CO2? The answer depends on the relative strength of tree biomass and O-horizon N immobilization vs. widening C-to-N ratios and ecosystem-N accrual as processes that drive and delay PNL, respectively. Only direct observations through time will definitively answer this question.},

In previous research, we showed that net primary production (NPP) increased by 23 {\textpm} 2\% when four experimental forests were grown under atmospheric concentrations of CO2 predicted for the latter half of this century. Because nitrogen (N) availability commonly limits forest productivity, some combination of increased N uptake from the soil and more efficient use of the N already assimilated by trees is necessary to sustain the high rates of forest NPP under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE). In this study, experimental evidence demonstrates that the uptake of N increased under elevated CO2 at the Rhinelander, Duke, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites, yet fertilization studies at the Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites showed that tree growth and forest NPP were strongly limited by N availability. By contrast, nitrogen-use efficiency increased under elevated CO2 at the POP-EUROFACE site, where fertilization studies showed that N was not limiting to tree growth. Some combination of increasing fine root production, increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition, and increased allocation of carbon (C) to mycorrhizal fungi is likely to account for greater N uptake under elevated CO2. Regardless of the specific mechanism, this analysis shows that the larger quantities of C entering the below-ground system under elevated CO2 result in greater N uptake, even in N-limited ecosystems. Biogeochemical models must be reformulated to allow C transfers below ground that result in additional N uptake under elevated CO2.},

It simulates the effect of [CO2] on the photosynthetic rate by an empirical parameter ({$\beta$}-factor), which is calibrated based on observed biomass under varied [CO2]. Rice growth is linked to CH4 emission through rhizodeposition of C and the rice plant's conductance of CH4, which depend on the root biomass and tiller density, respectively. DNDC-Rice was tested using five years of rice growth data and four years of CH4 emission data from a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in a Japanese rice field, in which [CO2] was controlled at 200 ppm above ambient. In the experiment, FACE increased the average final aboveground biomass by 11\% and seasonal CH4 emission by 22\%. By calibrating the {$\beta$}-factor of photosynthesis calculation, DNDC-Rice successfully predicted the final aboveground biomass across the years and the [CO2] treatments. However, it underestimated the enhancement of CH4 emission by FACE, to be only 9\% as the average over the four years. We found this discrepancy to be attributed to the modeling of photosynthesis, root growth and exudation, and rice tiller conductance of CH4 under elevated [CO2]. These results indicate that DNDC-Rice needs to be further refined using detailed data on these plant processes in order to simulate future CH4 emission under elevated [CO2].},

  abstract = {Current carbon cycle models attribute rising atmospheric CO2 as the major driver of the increased terrestrial carbon sink, but with substantial uncertainties. The photosynthetic response of trees to elevated atmospheric CO2 is a necessary step, but not the only one, for sustaining the terrestrial carbon uptake, but can vary diurnally, seasonally and with duration of CO2 exposure. Hence, we sought to quantify the photosynthetic response of the canopy-dominant species, Quercus robur, in a mature deciduous forest to elevated CO2 (eCO2) (+150~{$\mu$}mol~mol-1 CO2) over the first 3~years of a long-term free air CO2 enrichment facility at the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research in central England (BIFoR FACE). Over 3000 measurements of leaf gas exchange and related biochemical parameters were conducted in the upper canopy to assess the diurnal and seasonal responses of photosynthesis during the 2nd and 3rd year of eCO2 exposure. Measurements of photosynthetic capacity via biochemical parameters, derived from CO2 response curves, (Vcmax and Jmax) together with leaf nitrogen concentrations from the pre-treatment year to the 3rd year of eCO2 exposure, were examined. We hypothesized an initial enhancement in light-saturated net photosynthetic rates (Asat) with CO2 enrichment of {$\approx$}37\% based on theory but also expected photosynthetic capacity would fall over the duration of the study. Over the 3-year period, Asat of upper-canopy leaves was 33~{\textpm}~8\% higher (mean and standard error) in trees grown in eCO2 compared with ambient CO2 (aCO2), and photosynthetic enhancement decreased with decreasing light. There were no significant effects of CO2 treatment on Vcmax or Jmax, nor leaf nitrogen. Our results suggest that mature Q. robur may exhibit a sustained, positive response to eCO2 without photosynthetic downregulation, suggesting that, with adequate nutrients, there will be sustained enhancement in C assimilated by these mature trees. Further research will be required to understand the location and role of the additionally assimilated carbon.},

(Clone Jean Pourtet) and P. {\texttimes} euramericana (Clone I-214)) growing in a managed, high-density forest plantation were exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) at CO2 concentrations expected to occur in the future (550 ppm). Leaf area index (optical LAI), measured with a fish-eye-type plant canopy analyzer, was not significantly affected by FACE after canopy closure in the second growing season. However, when stands of similar size were compared, optical LAI and number of main stem leaves were reduced by FACE. Allometric relationships, which were established to scale-up leaf area to the stand level (allometric LAI), did not differ between the FACE and control plots. Allometric LAI increased in response to FACE, as a result of increased tree dimensions and increased individual leaf size. We postulate that, although FACE increased allometric LAI, FACE had no effect on optical LAI after canopy closure, because FACE caused increased shading and competition resulting in enhanced leaf fall or leaf turnover. Specific leaf area (SLA) was unaffected by FACE. Allometric relationships and relative responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment were genotype-dependent.},

  abstract = {Modelling is used to predict long-term forest responses to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Although productivity models are based on light intercepted by the canopy, very little experimental data are available for closed forest stands. Nevertheless, the relationships between light inside a canopy, leaf area, canopy structure, and individual leaf characteristics may be affected by elevated CO2, affecting in turn carbon gain. Using a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) design in a high-density plantation of Populus spp., we studied the effects of increased CO2 concentrations on transmittance ({$\tau$}) of photosynthetic photon flux density (Qp), on ratios of red/far-red light (R/FR), on leaf area index (LAI), on leaf inclination, on leaf chlorophyll (chl) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and on specific leaf area (SLA) in the 2nd and 3rd years of treatment. Continuous measurements of {$\tau$} were made in addition to canopy height profiles of light and leaf characteristics. Two years of Qp measurements showed an average decrease of canopy transmittance in the FACE treatment, with very small differences at canopy closure. Results were explained by an unaffected LAI in closed canopies, without a FACE-induced stimulation of relative crown depth. In agreement, leaf inclination and extinction coefficients for light were similar in control and FACE conditions. Ratios of R/FR were not significantly affected by the FACE treatment, neither were leaf characteristics, with the exception of leaf N, which allows speculation about N limitation. In general, treatment differences in canopy profiles resulted from an initial stimulation of height growth in the FACE treatment. P. {\texttimes} euramericana differed from P. alba and P. nigra, but species did not differ significantly in their response to the FACE treatment. By the time fast-growing high-density forest plantations have passed the exponential growth phase and reached canopy closure, the likely effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on canopy architecture and absorption of Qp are minor.},

The FACE treatment stimulated gross primary productivity by 22 and 11\% in the second and third years, respectively. Partitioning of extra carbon (C) among C pools of different turnover rates is of critical interest; thus, we calculated net ecosystem productivity (NEP) to determine whether elevated atmospheric [CO2] will enhance net plantation C storage capacity. Free-air CO2 enrichment increased net primary productivity (NPP) of all genotypes by 21\% in the second year and by 26\% in the third year, mainly because of an increase in the size of C pools with relatively slow turnover rates (i.e., wood). In all genotypes in the FACE treatment, more new soil C was added to the total soil C pool compared with the control treatment. However, more old soil C loss was observed in the FACE treatment compared with the control treatment, possibly due to a priming effect from newly incorporated root litter. FACE did not significantly increase NEP, probably as a result of this priming effect.},

The apparent availability of nitrate and ammonium for plants was estimated during a representative, vegetative re-growth period at weekly intervals from the sorption of the minerals to mixed-bed ion-exchange resin bags at a soil depth of 5 cm. N mineralisation was measured using sequential coring and in situ exposure of soil cores in the top 10 cm of the soil before and after the first cut in spring 1997. High amounts of mineral N were bound to the ion exchange resin during the first week of re-growth. This was probably the combined result of the fertiliser application, the weak demand for N by the newly cut sward and presumably high rates of root decay and exudation after cutting the sward. During the first 2 weeks after the application of fertiliser N at the first cut, there was a dramatic reduction in available N; N remained low during the subsequent weeks of re-growth in all treatments. Overall, nitrate was the predominant form of mineral N that bound to the resin for the duration of the experiment. Apparently, there was always more nitrate than ammonium available to the plants in the high N fertilisation treatment for the whole re-growth period. Apparent N availability was affected significantly by elevated pCO2 only in the first week after the cut; under high N fertilisation, elevated pCO2 increased the amount of mineral N that was apparently available to the plants. Elevated pCO2 did not affect apparent net transformation of N, loss of N or uptake of N by plants. The present data are consistent with earlier results and suggest that the amount of N available to plants from soil resources does not generally increase under elevated atmospheric pCO2. Thus, a possible limiting effect of N on primary production could become more stringent under elevated atmospheric pCO2 as the demand of the plant for N increases.},

In ecosys, water relations are simulated by solving for the canopy water potential (psi(C)) at which water uptake from a model of soil-root-canopy water transfer equilibrates with transpiration from the canopy energy balance. Simulated water relations were tested with psi(C), water uptake, and energy exchange measured under ambient (363 micromol mol(-1)) and elevated (566 micromol mol(-1)) C(a) and high vs. low irrigation in a free air CO2 enrichment experiment during 1998 and 1999. Model results, corroborated by field measurements, showed that elevated C(a) raised psi(C) and lowered latent heat fluxes under high irrigation and delayed water stress under low irrigation. Changes in psi(C) modeled under ambient vs. elevated C(a) varied diurnally, with lower psi(C) causing earlier midafternoon stomatal closure under ambient C(a). Modeled changes in sorghum water status caused elevated C(a) to raise seasonal water efficiency under high and low irrigation by 20 and 26\% (vs. 20 and 13\% measured) in 1998 and by 9 and 27\% (vs. 6 and 26\% measured) in 1999. Ecosys was used to generate an irrigation response function for sorghum yield, which indicated that yields would rise by approximately equal to 13\% for a range of irrigation rates if air temperatures were to rise by 3 degrees C and C(a) by 50\%. Current high sorghum yields could be achieved with approximately equal to 120 mm or approximately equal to 20\% less irrigation water if these rises in temperature and C(a) were to occur.},

Responses were evaluated in relation to one another, and to seasonal patterns and natural environmental stresses, including high temperatures, vapour pressure deficits (VPD), and drought. Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) averaged 46\% higher in the +200 {\textmu}mol mol-1 CO2 treatment, in mid- and upper canopy foliage. Stomatal conductance (gs) averaged 14\% (mid-canopy) and 24\% (upper canopy) lower under CO2 enrichment. Variations in the relative responses of A and gs were linked, such that greater relative stimulation of A was observed on dates when relative reductions in gs were slight. Dry soils and high VPD reduced gs and A in both treatments, and tended to diminish treatment differences. The absolute effects of CO2 on A and gs were minimized whenever gs was low ({$<$}0{$\cdot$}15 mol m-2 s-1), but relative effects, as the ratio of elevated to ambient rates, varied greatly under those conditions. Both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of A were involved during late season droughts. Leaf temperature had a limited influence on A and gs, and there was no detectable relationship between prevailing temperature and CO2 effects on A or gs. The responsiveness of A and gs to elevated CO2, both absolute and relative, was maintained through time and within the canopy of this forest stand, subject to seasonal constraints and variability associated with limiting air and soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Although photosynthetic response to long-term elevated CO2 has been extensively studied, little attention has yet been directed at coordinated adjustments between the use of absorbed light for CO2 fixation, and the dissipation of potentially harmful excess light. In this study, we have performed an initial analysis of photosynthetic light use and excess light dissipation in response to grazing-induced variation in the source\,/\,sink ratio in ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) after 6 years' exposure to Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE). Before grazing, when the source\,/\,sink ratio was relatively large, significant down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity (Amax) was observed in the FACE leaves compared with control leaves at the same stage of maturity. The decrease in Amax partly offset the direct stimulation of elevated CO2 on light-saturated photosynthesis, and was accompanied by a reduction in photochemical electron flow that was accompanied by a large increase in susceptibility to photoinhibition. This was indicated by large increases in both non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the de-epoxidised state of xanthophyll cycle (DEPS), and also by changes in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). However, no significant increase in the xanthophyll pool size in FACE leaves was observed, despite the apparent large increase in requirements for photodissipation in FACE leaves. After grazing, when the source\,/\,sink ratio was relatively small, the CO2 fixation rates in both the FACE and control leaves were, as expected, significantly higher compared with those before grazing, and there was no down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity in the leaves under FACE conditions. In addition, the extent of photodissipation in the FACE and control leaves was not significantly different. Overall, the profile of leaf physiological and biochemical responses supports the hypothesis that the effect of long-term elevated CO2 can be significantly influenced by short-term variation in the source\,/\,sink ratio. As the xanthophyll pool size does not change significantly, this poses the question of whether the increased photodissipative demand observed here under even moderately elevated CO2 concentrations may lead to increased plant susceptibility to photoinhibition, and thus to an increased risk of damage to plant function, under conditions of low sink demand. This question clearly deserves further study.},

Using microcosms, we measured initial C mineralization and leaching rates of DOC, DON and biodegradable DOC from litter of eight tree species from CO2 enrichment experiments in a 100 year-old broadleaf forest and a 30 year-old treeline ecosystem. Over 11 weekly leaching cycles, between 2.5\% (Pinus uncinata, Fagus sylvatica) and 15\% (Carpinus betulus) of litter C were leached as DOC, corresponding to 9--36\% of the total mass loss. Significantly less, 0.9\% (Pinus) to 4.5\% (Tilia platyphyllos) of litter N was leached as DON. Leaching of DOC was not correlated to C mineralization, which ranged between 12\% (Fagus) and 32\% (Tilia) of litter C. While C mineralization increased with decreasing litter C/N ratios and lignin contents, DOC leaching particularly the initially leached DOC was significantly related to concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and phenolics. DOC leached after the third leaching cycle did not correlate with any of the measures of litter quality, but with the molar UV absorptivity of DOC, suggesting that DOC production is linked to lignin degradation. Previous CO2 enrichment increased NSC and phenolics in the litter and decreased lignin contents, which resulted in significantly greater initial C mineralization (+5\%) and DOC leaching rates (+16\%). However, these CO2 effects were only significant during the initial leaching phase and much smaller than the differences between tree species. Initially leached DOC was less biodegradable when its parent litter was grown under elevated than under ambient CO2 (38\% vs. 42\% of DOC across all species, P{$<$}0.05). Therefore, leaching of `refractory' DOC was increased under elevated CO2, which will rather accelerate DOC inputs into mineral soils than further stimulate microbial activity. In summary, our study shows (1) that initial DOM leaching is controlled by other factors than C mineralization; and (2) that CO2 enrichment of forests can stimulate initial mineralization and leaching of C from litter by altering its quality, but these effects will be short-term and much smaller than any change in species composition.},

We exposed young beech--spruce model ecosystems on an acidic loam and calcareous sand for 4{$\quad$}years to elevated CO               2               . The added CO               2               was depleted in               13               C, allowing to trace new C inputs in the plant--soil system. We measured CO               2               -derived new C in soil C pools fractionated into particle sizes and monitored respiration as well as leaching of this new C during incubation for 1{$\quad$}year. Soil type played a crucial role in the partitioning of C. The net input of new C into soils under elevated CO               2               was about 75\% greater in the acidic loam than in the calcareous sand, despite a 100\% and a 45\% greater above- and below-ground biomass on the calcareous sand. This was most likely caused by a higher turnover of C in the calcareous sand as indicated by 30\% higher losses of new C from the calcareous sand than from the acidic loam during incubation. Therefore, soil properties determining stabilization of soil C were apparently more important for the accumulation of C in soils than tree productivity. Soil fractionation revealed that about 60\% of the CO               2               -derived new soil C was incorporated into sand fractions. Low natural               13               C abundance and wide C/N ratios show that sand fractions comprise little decomposed organic matter. Consistently, incubation indicated that new soil C was preferentially respired as CO               2               . During the first month, evolved CO               2               consisted to 40--55\% of new C, whereas the fraction of new C in bulk soil C was 15--23\% only. Leaching of DOC accounted for 8--23\% of the total losses of new soil C. The overall effects of CO               2               enrichment on soil C were small in both soils, although tree growth increased significantly on the calcareous sand. Our results suggest that the potential of soils for C sequestration is limited, because only a small fraction of new C inputs into soils will become long-term soil C.},

We also tracked the 13C signal of supplemental CO2 in soil-respired CO2, microbial biomass, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in undisturbed mor-type organic layers. We found a persistently increased soil CO2 efflux (+24\% on average), but negligible effects of elevated CO2 on the biomass and community structure of soil microorganisms under both tree species determined with PLFA and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). The 13C tracing over 9 years revealed that 24--40\% of the soil microbial biomass was composed of `new' plant-derived C. PLFA from gram-negative biomarkers did not significant shift in 13C by the CO2 addition, while those of gram-negative bacteria were significantly altered. The highest 13C signals in individual PLFA was found in the fatty acid 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 with 65--80\% new C, indicating that new plant-derived C was primarily incorporated by soil fungi. However, CO2 enrichment did not affect the production of mycelia biomass and the structure and composition of the fungal communities analysed by high-throughput 454-sequencing of genetic markers. Collectively, our results suggest that C flux through the plant--soil system will be accelerated but that the biomass and composition of microbial communities will be little affected by rising atmospheric CO2 in organic matter rich treeline soils.},

  abstract = {Abstract Of all terrestrial ecosystems, the productivity of deserts has been suggested to be the most responsive to increasing atmospheric CO2. The extent to which this prediction holds will depend in part on plant responses to elevated CO2under the highly variable conditions characteristic of arid regions. The photosynthetic responses ofLarrea tridentata , an evergreen shrub, to a step-increase in atmospheric CO2(to 550 {$\mu$}molmol-1) were examined in the field using Free-Air CO2Enrichment (FACE) under seasonally varying moisture conditions. Elevated CO2substantially increased net assimilation rate (Anet) in Larrea during both moist and dry periods of the potential growing season, while stomatal conductance (gs) did not differ between elevated and ambient CO2treatments. Seasonal and diurnal gas exchange dynamics in elevated CO2mirrored patterns in ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2did not extend photosynthetic activity longer into the dry season or during more stressful times of the day. Net assimilation vs. internal CO2(A/Ci) responses showed no evidence of photosynthetic down-regulation during the dry season. In contrast, after significant autumn rains, Amax(the CO2saturated rate of photosynthesis) and CE (carboxylation efficiency) were lower in Larrea under elevated CO2. In situ chlorophyll fluorescence estimation ofLarrea Photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm) responded more to water limitation than to elevated CO2. These findings suggest that predictions regarding desert plant responses to elevated CO2should account for seasonal patterns of photosynthetic regulatory responses, which may vary across species and plant functional types.},

After 4~years, basal area of pine trees was 9.2\% larger in elevated than in ambient CO2 plots. During the first 3~years the growth rate of pine was stimulated by {\textasciitilde}26\%. In the fourth year this stimulation declined to 23\%. The average net ecosystem production (NEP) in the ambient plots was 428~gC~m--2~year--1, indicating that the forest was a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO2 stimulated NEP by 41\%. This increase was primarily an increase in plant biomass increment (57\%), and secondarily increased accumulation of carbon in the forest floor (35\%) and fine root increment (8\%). Net primary production (NPP) was stimulated by 27\%, driven primarily by increases in the growth rate of the pines. Total heterotrophic respiration (Rh) increased by 165\%, but total autotrophic respiration (Ra) was unaffected. Gross primary production was increased by 18\%. The largest uncertainties in the carbon budget remain in separating belowground heterotrophic (soil microbes) and autotrophic (root) respiration. If applied to temperate forests globally, the increase in NEP that we measured would fix less than 10\% of the anthropogenic CO2 projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. This may represent an upper limit because rising global temperatures, land disturbance, and heterotrophic decomposition of woody tissues will ultimately cause an increased flux of carbon back to the atmosphere.},

At the Duke Forest free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) facility in North Carolina (FACTS-1 research facility), we measured the amount of leaf tissue damaged by insects and other herbivorous arthropods during two growing seasons in a deciduous forest understory continuously exposed to ambient (360 microl l(-1)) and elevated (approximately 560 microl l(-1)) CO(2) conditions. In 1999, there was a significant interaction between CO(2) and species such that winged elm ( Ulmus alata) showed lower herbivory in elevated CO(2) plots, whereas red maple (Acer rubra) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) did not. In 2000, our results did not achieve statistical significance but the magnitude of the result was consistent with the 1999 results. In 1999 and 2000, we found a decline (10-46\%) in community-level herbivory in elevated CO(2) plots driven primarily by reductions in herbivory on elm. The major contribution to total leaf damage was from missing tissue (66\% of the damaged tissue), with galls, skeletonized, and discolored tissue making smaller contributions. It is unclear whether the decline in leaf damage is a result of altered insect populations, altered feeding, or a combination. We were not able to quantify insect populations, and our measurements did not resolve an effect of elevated CO(2) on leaf chemical composition (total nitrogen, carbon, C/N, sugars, phenolics, starch). Despite predictions from a large number of single-species studies that herbivory may increase under elevated CO(2), we have found a decrease in herbivory in a naturally established forest understory exposed to a full suite of insect herbivores and their predators.},

  abstract = {Historically, carbon limitation, through a shortage of photoassimilates has been argued to limit the growth of trees at the upper altitudinal treeline. In a three-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, two species of 30-year-old alpine conifers (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) were studied to test this hypothesis in situ in the Swiss Central Alps (2180 m above sea level). CO2 enrichment was combined with foliage removal to test the effect of altered source-sink relationships on tree growth and leaf level responses. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis and increased nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the needles of both species. While the deciduous larch trees showed longer needles and a stimulation of shoot growth over all three seasons when grown in situ under elevated CO2, pine trees showed no such responses. Irrespective of CO2 concentration, defoliation in both species stimulated photosynthesis and increased stomatal conductance in remaining current-year needles in the treatment year and reduced leaf nitrogen concentration in the year following defoliation. Defoliated larch trees had fewer and shorter needles with reduced NSC concentrations in the year following defoliation and showed no stimulation in shoot elongation when exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, defoliation of evergreen pine trees had no effect on needle NSC concentrations, but stimulated shoot elongation when defoliated trees were exposed to elevated CO2. After three years, our results suggest that deciduous larch is carbon limited at treeline, while evergreen pine is not. However, as indicated by the defoliation treatment, the carbon economy of these trees can clearly be modified by extreme events. The expected changes in growth of these treeline trees with improving carbon availability as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase will thus depend on both the interplay between biotic and abiotic processes, and the species or tree functional types involved.},

While these strong below-ground responses have predominantly been observed in rapidly expanding systems, late successional plant communities have rarely been studied.  2In an ongoing free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, we assessed below-ground responses to elevated CO2 after 4 years, in a treeline ecosystem in the Swiss Central Alps (2180~m a.s.l.) dominated by a late successional ericaceous dwarf shrub community (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. uliginosum, Empetrum hermaphroditum), and a sparse overstorey of 30-year-old Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata trees. Measurements included quantification of fine root growth using ingrowth root cores and parallel standing crop harvests and decomposition of roots using litter bags.  3Elevated CO2 did not stimulate root growth of the treated vegetation (although some significant above-ground growth responses were observed), nor did altered root decomposition occur. Root quality measurements indicated that elevated CO2 resulted in significantly higher starch concentrations, but no change in N concentration, or root dehydrogenase activity.  4The use of the stable isotope {$\delta$}13C permitted us to trace the new carbon entering the system through our CO2 enrichment treatment. We observed that only c. 30\% of new root biomass ({$<~$}2~mm) was formed by new carbon indicating a rather slow root turnover in this system.  5Our data show that fine root growth may be much less stimulated by elevated CO2 in systems with late successional elements than has been reported in ecosystems with a rapidly expanding plant community biomass.},

Thus, N budgets were established for four years under ambient and 60{$\quad$}Pa pCO               2               at two levels of N fertilization in two contrasting model ecosystems:               Trifolium repens               L.

While               T. repens               showed an 80\% increase in harvested biomass with no change in biomass allocation under elevated atmospheric pCO               2               compared to ambient conditions,               L. perenne               showed an increase only in the biomass of the roots.

Nitrogen retention in the soil was between 4 and 64{$\quad$}g{$\quad$}m               2               . The               L. perenne               system gained the most N and retained the most N in the soil at high N fertilization and elevated atmospheric pCO               2               .

Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments aim to predict the likely responses of plants to increased [CO2] under normal climatic conditions. The Giessen FACE system operates a lower [CO2] enrichment regime (480 {$\mu$}mol mol--1) than standard FACE (550--600 {$\mu$}mol mol--1), permitting the analysis of a mixed species temperate meadow under a [CO2] level equivalent to that predicted in 25--30 years. We analysed the physiological and morphological responses of six species to investigate the effect of moderate [CO2] on spring biomass production. Carbon dioxide enrichment stimulated leaf photosynthetic rates and supressed respiration, contributing to enhanced net assimilation and a 23\% increase in biomass. The capacity for photosynthetic assimilation was unaffected by [CO2] enrichment, with no downregulation of rates of carboxylation of Rubisco or regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Foliar N content was also not influenced by increased [CO2]. Enhanced [CO2] reduced stomatal size, but stomatal density and leaf area index remained constant, suggesting that the effect on gas exchange was minimal.},

We investigated the effects of elevated CO2, N deposition, warming and increased precipitation on the composition of organic compounds in plant litter in a fully-factorial experiment conducted in a California annual grassland. While lignin increased within functional groups under elevated CO2, this effect was attenuated by warming in grasses and by water additions in forbs. CO2-induced increases in lignin within functional groups also were counteracted by an increase in the relative biomass of forbs, which contained less lignin than grasses. Consequently, there was no net change in the overall lignin content of senesced tissue at the plot level under elevated CO2. Nitrate additions increased N in both grass and forb litter, although this effect was attenuated by water additions. Relative to changes in N within functional groups, changes in functional group dominance had a minor effect on overall litter N at the plot level. Nitrate additions had the strongest effect on decomposition, increasing lignin losses from Avena litter and interacting with water additions to increase decomposition of litter of other grasses. Increases in lignin that resulted from elevated CO2 had no effect on decomposition but elevated CO2 increased N losses from Avena litter. Overall, the interactions among elements of global change were as important as single-factor effects in influencing plant litter chemistry.

  abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N) deposition, and climate change will alter ecosystem productivity and function in the coming decades, the combined effects of these environmental changes may be nonadditive, and their interactions may be altered by disturbances, such as fire. We examined the influence of a summer wildfire on the interactive effects of elevated CO2, N deposition, and increased precipitation in a full-factorial experiment conducted in a California annual grassland. In unburned plots, primary production was suppressed under elevated CO2. Burning alone did not significantly affect production, but it increased total production in combination with nitrate additions and removed the suppressive effect of elevated CO2. Increased production in response to nitrate in burned plots occurred as a result of the enhanced aboveground production of annual grasses and forbs, whereas the removal of the suppressive effect of elevated CO2 occurred as a result of increased aboveground forb production in burned, CO2-treated plots and decreased root production in burned plots under ambient CO2.The tissue nitrogen--phosphorus ratio, which was assessed for annual grass shoots, decreased with burning and increased with nitrate addition. Burning removed surface litter from plots, resulting in an increase in maximum daily soil temperatures and a decrease in soil moisture both early and late in the growing season. Measures of vegetation greenness, based on canopy spectral reflectance, showed that plants in burned plots grew rapidly early in the season but senesced early. Overall, these results indicate that fire can alter the effects of elevated CO2 and N addition on productivity in the short term, possibly by promoting increased phosphorus availability.},

The sweetgum trees were naturally established in a 15-year-old forest dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Measurements were made in early June and late August 1997 during the first full year of CO2 fumigation in the Duke Forest FACE experiment. Sun leaves had a 68\% greater leaf mass per unit area, 63\% more leaf N per unit leaf area, 27\% more chlorophyll per unit leaf area and 77\% greater light-saturated photosynthetic rates than shade leaves. Elevated CO2 strongly stimulated light-saturated photosynthetic rates of sun and shade leaves in June and August; however, the relative photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 for sun leaves was more than double the relative enhancement of shade leaves. Elevated CO2 stimulated apparent quantum yield by 30\%, but there was no interaction between CO2 and leaf position. Daytime leaf-level carbon gain extrapolated from photosynthetic light response curves indicated that sun leaves were enhanced 98\% by elevated CO2, whereas shade leaves were enhanced 41\%. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect leaf N per unit area in sun or shade leaves during either measurement period. Thus, the greater CO2 enhancement of light-saturated photosynthesis in sun leaves than in shade leaves was probably a result of a greater amount of nitrogen per unit leaf area in sun leaves. A full understanding of the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on forest ecosystems must take account of the complex nature of the light environment through the canopy and how light interacts with CO2 to affect photosynthesis.},

Sun and shade leaves were subdivided into early leaves (formed in the overwintering bud) and late leaves (formed during the growing season). Overall, we found that leaf-level net photosynthetic rates were enhanced by atmospheric CO2 enrichment throughout the season until early November; however, sun leaves showed a greater response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment than shade leaves. Elevated [CO2] did not affect leaf longevity, emergence date or abscission date of sun leaves or shade leaves. Leaf number and leaf area per shoot were unaffected by CO2 treatment. A simple shoot photosynthesis model indicated that elevated [CO2] stimulated photosynthesis by 60\% in sun shoots, but by only 3\% in shade shoots. Whole-shoot photosynthetic rate was more than 12 times greater in sun shoots than in shade shoots. In senescent leaves, elevated [CO2] did not affect residual leaf nitrogen, and nitrogen resorption was largely unaffected by atmospheric CO2 enrichment, except for a small decrease in shade leaves. Overall, elevated [CO2] had little effect on the number of leaves per shoot at any time during the season and, therefore, did not change seasonal carbon gain by extending or shortening the growing season. Stimulation of carbon gain by atmospheric CO2 enrichment in sweetgum trees growing in the Duke Forest FACE experiment was the result of a strong stimulation of photosynthesis throughout the growing season.},

  abstract = {This study examined root production and turnover in a California grassland during the third year of a long-term experiment with ambient (LO) and twice-ambient atmospheric CO2 (HI), using harvests, ingrowth cores, and minirhizotrons. Based on one-time harvest data, root biomass was 32\% greater in the HI treatment, comparable to the stimulation of aboveground production during the study year. However, the 30--70\% increase in photosynthesis under elevated CO2 for the dominant species in our system is considerably larger than the combined increase in above and belowground biomass. One possible explanation is, increased root turnover, which could be a sink for the additional fixed carbon. Cumulative root production in ingrowth cores from both treatments harvested at four dates was 2--3 times that in the single harvested cores, suggesting substantial root turnover within the growing season. Minirhizotron data confirmed this result, demonstrating that production and mortality occurred simultaneously through much of the season. As a result, cumulative root production was 54\%, 47\% and 44\% greater than peak standing root length for the no chamber (X), LO, and HI plots, respectively. Elevated CO2, however, had little effect on rates of turnover (i.e. rates of turnover were equal in the LO and HI plots throughout most of the year) and cumulative root production was unaffected by treatment. Elevated CO2 increased monthly production of new root length (59\%) only at the end of the season (April--June) when root growth had largely ceased in the LO plots but continued in the HI plots. This end-of-season increase in production coincided with an 18\% greater soil moisture content in the HI plots previously described. Total standing root length was not affected by CO2 treatment. Root mortality was unaffected by elevated CO2 in all months except April, in which plants grown in the HI plots had higher mortality rates. Together, these results demonstrate that root turnover is considerable in the grassland community and easily missed by destructive soil coring. However, increased fine root turnover under elevated CO2 is apparently not a major sink for extra photosynthate in this system.},

We compared the effects of CO2 enrichment on both single-leaf and whole-canopy photosynthetic rates in cotton. We also determined whole-canopy photosynthetic and transpiration rates in cotton in response to CO2 enrichment and differential irrigation. Field-grown cotton was exposed to either 550 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 of CO2 using the free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) system or to 370 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 in control plots. In the second year of the experiment, half of each plot received reduced levels of irrigation. Rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of single leaves were determined using a portable photosynthesis system and a portable steady-state porometer, respectively. Rates of whole-canopy photosynthesis and transpiration were determined using a custom-built chamber (about 1 m {\texttimes} 1 m). Midday net photosynthetic rates of both leaves and canopies were 19--41\% higher in the CO2-enriched plots than in control plots. The CO2 effect on leaf photosynthesis was greatest in July, whereas the CO2 effect on canopy photosynthesis was greatest in June and decreased thereafter as mutual shading of leaves and the amount of non-photosynthetic biomass increased. Midday stomatal conductance values of leaves were 13--44\% greater in control plants than in CO2-enriched plants. Except for late in the second season, canopy transpiration rates were not affected by the CO2 treatment because the decrease in stomatal conductance was offset by an increase in plant size. Differential irrigation led to no significant differences in either canopy photosynthesis or transpiration, possibly because differential irrigation was applied only during the second half of the season. It appears that cotton crops grown in a future, higher-CO2 climate may have increased photosynthetic rates, but water requirements may not be reduced.},

Elevated CO2 (537 versus 409~{$\mu$}l~l-1) increased biomass production except for leaves. In total, levels of 16 grain metabolites were decreased and four were increased. CO2 enrichment resulted in significant decreases of amino acids such as o-acetyl-L-homoserine, leucine, arginine, L-homoserine and the group of ornithine, arginine and citrulline and negative trends for norleucine, L-aspartate, proline, L-cysteine and tyrosine.

Among sugars and sugar derivatives, ribose-5-P was significantly increased, while gluconate-6-P was decreased. There were also negative CO2-induced effects on sugar alcohols: significant for glycerol-2-P (P~=~0.008) and almost significant for myo-inositol-P (P~=~0.066). In contrast, organic acids such as pyruvate and glucuronic acid were significantly increased. Overall, the N-rich metabolites especially were reduced.

Parasitized and non-parasitized forest tent caterpillars were reared on two aspen genotypes under elevated levels of CO2 and O3, alone and in combination. Foliage was collected for determination of the chemical composition of leaves fed upon by forest tent caterpillars during the period of endoparasitoid larval development. Elevated CO2 decreased nitrogen levels but had no effect on concentrations of carbon-based compounds. In contrast, elevated O3 decreased nitrogen and phenolic glycoside levels, but increased concentrations of starch and condensed tannins. Foliar chemistry also differed between aspen genotypes. CO2, O3, genotype, and their interactions altered forest tent caterpillar performance, and differentially so between sexes. In general, enriched CO2 had little effect on forest tent caterpillar performance under ambient O3, but reduced performance (for insects on one aspen genotype) under elevated O3. Conversely, elevated O3 improved forest tent caterpillar performance under ambient, but not elevated, CO2. Parasitoid larval survivorship decreased under elevated O3, depending upon levels of CO2 and aspen genotype. Additionally, larval performance and masses of mature female parasitoids differed between aspen genotypes. These results suggest that host-parasitoid interactions in forest systems may be altered by atmospheric conditions anticipated for the future, and that the degree of change may be influenced by plant genotype.},

This paper focuses on water chemistry, plant nutrient content, and litter decomposition rates. Potassium limitation, or low supply of K and P, may have prevented a significant increase of Sphagnum growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition. Vascular plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition was also limited by K, or by K in combination with P or N (N in CO2 experiment). Elevated CO2 and N deposition had no effect on decomposition rates of Sphagnum and vascular plant litter. Aside from a possible effect of N deposition on light competition between species, we expect that elevated atmospheric CO2 and N deposition concentrations will not affect Sphagnum and vascular plant growth in bogs of north-west Europe due to K-, or K in combination with N- or P-, limited growth. For the same reason we expect no effect of elevated CO2 and N deposition on litter decomposition. Net primary production of raised ombrotrophic bogs that are at or close to steady state, is regulated by input of nutrients through atmospheric deposition. Therefore, we hypothesize that the expected increase of plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition is diminished by current levels of K (and to some extent P and N) in atmospheric deposition.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Through increases in net primary production (NPP), elevated CO2 is hypothesized to increase the amount of plant litter entering the soil. The fate of this extra carbon on the forest floor or in mineral soil is currently not clear. Moreover, increased rates of NPP can be maintained only if forests can escape nitrogen limitation. In a Free atmospheric CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment near Bangor, Wales, 4 ambient and 4 elevated [CO2] plots were planted with patches of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Fagus sylvatica on a former arable field. After 4 years, biomass averaged for the 3 species was 5497 (se 270) g m-2 in ambient and 6450 (se 130) g m-2 in elevated [CO2] plots, a significant increase of 17\% (P = 0.018). During that time, only a shallow L forest floor litter layer had formed due to intensive bioturbation. Total soil C and N contents increased irrespective of treatment and species as a result of afforestation. We could not detect an additional C sink in the soil, nor were soil C stabilization processes affected by elevated [CO2]. We observed a decrease of leaf N content in Betula and Alnus under elevated [CO2], while the soil C/N ratio decreased regardless of CO2 treatment. The ratio of N taken up from the soil and by N2-fixation in Alnus was not affected by elevated [CO2]. We infer that increased nitrogen use efficiency is the mechanism by which increased NPP is sustained under elevated [CO2] at this site.},

Two cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Scout and Yitpi, purportedly differing in water use efficiency related traits (e.g. transpiration efficiency) but with common genetic backgrounds were studied in a high yielding, high rainfall (2013), and in a low yielding, very dry growing season (2014) under Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE, CO2 concentration of approximately 550{$\mu$}molmol-1) and ambient (approximately 390{$\mu$}molmol-1) CO2. Gas exchange measurements were collected diurnally between stem elongation and anthesis. Aboveground biomass and nutrient content (sum of Ca, K, S, P, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn and Mg) were determined at anthesis. Yield, yield components and harvest index were measured at physiological maturity. Cultivar Scout showed transiently greater transpiration efficiency (measured by gas exchange) over cultivar Yitpi under both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions, mainly expressed in the high yielding but not in the low yielding season. Nutrient content was on average 13\% greater for the lower transpiration efficiency cultivar Yitpi than the cultivar with higher transpiration efficiency (Scout) in the high yielding season across both CO2 concentrations. Elevated CO2 stimulated grain yield to a greater extent in the high yielding season than in the low yielding season where increased aboveground biomass earlier in the season did not translate into fertile tillers in cultivar Yitpi. Yield increased 27 and 33\% in the high yielding and 0 and 19\% in the low yielding season for cultivars Yitpi and Scout, respectively. Intraspecific variation in CO2 responsiveness related mechanisms of grain yield were observed. These results suggest CO2-driven trade-offs between traits governing water use efficiency are related to both growing season and intraspecific variations, and under very dry finishes, the trade-offs may even reverse. The negative relationship between nutrient content and transpiration efficiency among wheat genotypes will be maintained under elevated CO2 conditions.},

However, to date, there are few detailed analyses of how intact desert vegetation responds to elevated CO2. From 1998 to 2001, we examined aboveground production, photosynthesis, and water relations within three species exposed to ambient (around 38 Pa) or elevated (55 Pa) CO2 concentrations at the Nevada Desert Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) Facility in southern Nevada, USA. The functional types sampled---evergreen (Larrea tridentata), drought-deciduous (Ambrosia dumosa), and winter-deciduous shrubs (Krameria erecta)---represent potentially different responses to elevated CO2 in this ecosystem. We found elevated CO2 significantly increased aboveground production in all three species during an anomalously wet year (1998), with relative production ratios (elevated:ambient CO2) ranging from 1.59 (Krameria) to 2.31 (Larrea). In three below-average rainfall years (1999--2001), growth was much reduced in all species, with only Ambrosia in 2001 having significantly higher production under elevated CO2. Integrated photosynthesis (mol CO2 m-2 y-1) in the three species was 1.26--2.03-fold higher under elevated CO2 in the wet year (1998) and 1.32--1.43-fold higher after the third year of reduced rainfall (2001). Instantaneous WUE was also higher in shrubs grown under elevated CO2. The timing of peak canopy development did not change under elevated CO2; for example, there was no observed extension of leaf longevity into the dry season in the deciduous species. Similarly, seasonal patterns in CO2 assimilation did not change, except for Larrea. Therefore, phenological and physiological patterns that characterize Mojave Desert perennials---early-season lags in canopy development behind peak photosynthetic capacity, coupled with reductions in late-season photosynthetic capacity prior to reductions in leaf area---were not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Together, these findings suggest that elevated CO2 can enhance the productivity of Mojave Desert shrubs, but this effect is most pronounced during years with abundant rainfall when soil resources are most available.},

Plants were either fertilised with the addition of liquid fertiliser at a level of 212 kg N ha-1 year-1 or unfertilised after harvesting. No evidence was found of changes in the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (VCmax) and thus there was no photosynthetic downregulation caused by the FACE treatment in either P. {\texttimes} euramericana or P. nigra, but there was a marginally significant reduction in VCmax of fertilised P. alba (P{$<$}0.09). Carbon assimilation rates were significantly higher in FACE plants than control plants. Maximum carbon assimilation rate was stimulated by an average of 32.8\% in these clones, with individual stimulation values of 27.6\% for P. alba, 32.1\% for P. {\texttimes} euramericana and 49.5\% for P. nigra. No significant interactions between the FACE and fertilisation treatments were found for any of the photosynthetic variables measured. The day respiration rate in leaves of P.{\texttimes}euramericana was significantly increased by FACE treatment, but it was unaffected in the other clones. This work shows that photosynthesis remains stimulated at elevated CO2 concentration in these plants following harvesting, although to a lesser extent than seen normally, which may be related to a reduction in sink strength.},

  abstract = {We examined the effects of growth carbon dioxide (CO2)concentration and soil nutrient availability on nitrogen (N)transformations and N trace gas fluxes in California grasslandmicrocosms during early-season wet-up, a time when rates of Ntransformation and N trace gas flux are high. After plant senescenceand summer drought, we simulated the first fall rains and examined Ncycling. Growth at elevated CO2 increased root productionand root carbon:nitrogen ratio. Under nutrient enrichment, elevatedCO2 increased microbial N immobilization during wet-up,leading to a 43\% reduction in gross nitrification anda 55\% reduction in NO emission from soil. ElevatedCO2 increased microbial N immobilization at ambientnutrients, but did not alter nitrification or NO emission. ElevatedCO2 did not alter soil emission of N2O ateither nutrient level. Addition of NPK fertilizer (1:1:1) stimulatedN mineralization and nitrification, leading to increased N2Oand NO emission from soil. The results of our study support a mechanisticmodel in which elevated CO2 alters soil N cycling and NOemission: increased root production and increased C:N ratio in elevatedCO2 stimulate N immobilization, thereby decreasingnitrification and associated NO emission when nutrients are abundant.This model is consistent with our basic understanding of how C availabilityinfluences soil N cycling and thus may apply to many terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Annual and short-lived perennial plant performance during wet years is important for long-term persistence in the Mojave Desert. Additionally, the effects of elevated CO{$_2$} on desert plants may be relatively greater during years of high resource availability compared to dry years. Therefore, during an El Ni{\~n}o year at the Nevada Desert FACE Facility (a whole-ecosystem CO{$_2$} manipulation), we characterized photosynthetic investment (by assimilation rate-internal CO{$_2$} concentration relationships) and evaluated the seasonal pattern of net photosynthesis (\$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{net\}\}\$) and stomatal conductance (gs) for an invasive annual grass, Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens and a native herbaceous perennial, Eriogonum inflatum. Prior to and following flowering, Bromus showed consistent increases in both the maximum rate of carboxylation by Rubisco (\$V\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Cmax\}\}\$) and the light-saturated rate of electron flow (Jmax) at elevated CO{$_2$}. This resulted in greater \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{net\}\}\$ at elevated CO{$_2$} throughout most of the life cycle and a decrease in the seasonal decline of maximum midday \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{net\}\}\$ upon flowering as compared to ambient CO{$_2$}. Eriogonum showed significant photosynthetic down-regulation to elevated CO{$_2$} late in the season, but the overall pattern of maximum midday \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{net\}\}\$ was not altered with respect to phenology. For Eriogonum, this resulted in similar levels of \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{net\}\}\$ on a leaf area basis as the season progressed between CO{$_2$} treatments, but greater photosynthetic activity over a typical diurnal period. While gs did not consistently vary with CO{$_2$} in Bromus, it did decrease in Eriogonum at elevated CO{$_2$} throughout much of the season. Since the biomass of both plants increased significantly at elevated CO{$_2$}, these patterns of gas exchange highlight the differential mechanisms for increased plant growth. The species-specific interaction between CO{$_2$} and phenology in different growth forms suggests that important plant strategies may be altered by elevated CO{$_2$} in natural settings. These results indicate the importance of evaluating the effects of elevated CO{$_2$} at all life cycle stages to better understand the effects of elevated CO{$_2$} on whole-plant performance in natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to quantify the differences in soil carbon stores after exposure of birch seedlings (Betula pendula Roth.) over one growing season to ambient and elevated carbon dioxide concentrations. One-year-old seedling of birch were transplanted to pots containing `C4 soil' derived from beneath a maize crop, and placed in ambient (350 {$\mu$}L L-1) and elevated (600 {$\mu$}L L-1) plots in a free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment. After 186 days the plants and soils were destructively sampled, and analysed for differences in root and stem biomass, total plant tissue and soil C contents and {$\delta$}13C values. The trees showed a significant increase (+50\%) in root biomass, but stem and leaf biomasses were not significantly affected by treatment. C isotope analyses of leaves and fine roots showed that the isotopic signal from the ambient and elevated CO2 supply was sufficiently distinct from that of the `C4 soil' to enable quantification of net root C input to the soil under both ambient and elevated CO2. After 186 days, the pots under ambient conditions contained 3.5 g of C as intact root material, and had gained an additional 0.6 g C added to the soil through root exudation/turnover; comparable figures for the pots under elevated CO2 were 5.9 g C and 1.5 g C, respectively. These data confirm the importance of soils as an enhanced sink for C under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We propose the use of `C4 soils' in elevated CO2 experiments as an important technique for the quantification of root net C inputs under both ambient and elevated CO2 treatments.},

  abstract = {The N status of temperate forests is closely linked to their C fluxes, and altered C or N availability may affect ecosystem C storage through changes in forest production and C allocation. We proposed that increased fine-root production previously observed in a sweetgum ( Liquidambar styraciflua L.) forest in response to elevated [CO               2               ] was a physiological response to N limitation. To examine this premise, we fertilized plots in the sweetgum plantation adjacent to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory free-air CO               2               -enrichment (FACE) experiment. We hypothesized that N fertilization would increase sweetgum net primary production, leaf [N], and the relative flux of C to wood production. Annual additions of 200~kg{$\cdot$}ha               --1               of N as urea increased soil N availability, which increased stand net primary production, stand N uptake, and N requirement by about one-third. Increased leaf [N] and leaf area production in the fertilized plots increased stem production and shifted relative flux of C to wood production. We conclude that sweetgum production on this site is limited by soil N availability and a decreased fraction of net primary production in fine-root production with N addition is consistent with the premise that increased fine-root production in the adjacent FACE experiment is in response to N limitation.},

Biomass production (above-ground and below-ground) and allocation, as well as canopy structure and tissue nitrogen concentrations and contents, were examined by destructive harvest after 3 years. Elevated CO 2 increased total biomass production by 55\%, reduced needle area and needle mass as indicated, respectively, by lower leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio. A relatively smaller total needle area was produced in relation to fine roots under elevated CO 2 . The proportion of dry matter in roots was increased by elevated CO 2 , as indicated by increased root-to-shoot ratio and root mass ratio. Within the root system, there was a significant shift in the allocation towards fine roots. Root litter constituted a much higher fraction of fine roots in trees grown in the elevated CO 2 than in those grown in ambient CO 2 . Growth at elevated CO 2 caused a significant decline in nitrogen concentration only in the needles, while nitrogen content significantly increased in branches and fine roots (with diameter less than 1\,mm). There were no changes in crown structure (branch number and needle area distribution). Based upon measurements of growth made throughout the 3 years, the greatest increase in biomass under elevated CO 2 took place mainly at the beginning of the experiment, when trees grown in elevated CO 2 had higher relative growth rates than those grown under ambient CO 2 ; these differences disappeared with time. Symptoms of acclimation of trees to growth in the elevated CO 2 treatment were observed and are discussed. Copyright 2000 Annals of Botany Company},

  abstract = {Sustained increases in plant production in elevated CO2 depend on adequate belowground resources. Mechanisms for acquiring additional soil resources include increased root allocation and changes in root morphology or physiology. CO2 research to date has focused almost exclusively on changes in biomass and allocation. We examined physiological changes in nitrate and ammonium uptake in elevated CO2, hypothesizing that uptake rates would increase with the amount of available CO2. We combined our physiological estimates of nitrogen uptake with measurements of root biomass to assess whole root-system rates of nitrogen uptake. Surprisingly, physiological rates of ammonium uptake were unchanged with CO2, and rates of nitrate uptake actually decreased significantly (P{$<$}0.005). Root boomass increased 23\% in elevated CO2 (P{$<$}0.005), but almost all of this increase came in fertilized replicates. Rates of root-system nitrogen uptake in elevated CO2 increased for ammonium in nutrient-rich soil (P{$<$}0.05) and were unchanged for nitrate (P{$>$}0.80). Root-system rates of nitrogen uptake were more strongly correlated with physiological uptake rates than with root biomass in unamended soil, but the reverse was true in fertilized replicates. We discuss nitrogen uptake and changes in root biomass in the context of root nutrient concentrations (which were generally unchanged with CO2) and standing pools of belowground plant nitrogen. In research to date, there appears to be a fairly general increase in root biomass with elevated CO2, and little evidence of up-regulation in root physiology.},

Avena barbata in the field showed little evidence of photosynthetic downregulation with elevated CO2 at the end of the growing season (differences between treatments {$<$}10\%). Glasshouse studies also showed little evidence for downregulation of photosynthesis measured at various light and intercellular CO2. concentrations. Although specific leaf mass (leaf mass per unit leaf area) for Avena increased 20\% in the field with elevated CO2, leaf nitrogen concentrations decreased 25\%, resulting in an 11\% reduction in leaf N on a leaf-area basis. For the relatively wet 1993 growing season, Avena barbata increased its size and reproduction approximately 30\% in elevated CO2, with a 21\% decrease in population density. For the relatively dry 1994 season Avena density was almost doubled in elevated CO2, but increases in individual size and reproduction with CO2 were small (6-18\%). The primary effect of CO2 in the drier year appears to have been greater Avena survival, rather than increased individual size.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen 40\% since the start of the industrial revolution. Beginning in 1996, the Duke Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment has exposed plots in a loblolly pine forest to an additional 200 microL/L CO2 compared to trees growing in ambient CO2. This paper presents new belowground data and a synthesis of results through 2008, including root biomass and nutrient concentrations, soil respiration rates, soil pore-space CO2 concentrations, and soil-solution chemistry to 2 m depth. On average in elevated CO2, fine-root biomass in the top 15 cm of soil increased by 24\%, or 59 g/m2 (26 g/m2 C). Coarse-root biomass sampled in 2008 was twice as great in elevated CO2 and suggests a storage of approximately 20 g C x m(-2) x yr(-1). Root C and N concentrations were unchanged, suggesting greater belowground plant demand for N in high CO2. Soil respiration was significantly higher by 23\% on average as assessed by instantaneous infrared gas analysis and 24-h integrated estimates. N fertilization decreased soil respiration and fine-root biomass by approximately 10-20\% in both ambient and elevated CO2. In recent years, increases in root biomass and soil respiration grew stronger, averaging approximately 30\% at high CO2. Peak changes for root biomass, soil respiration, and other variables typically occurred in midsummer and diminished in winter. Soil CO2 concentrations between 15 and 100 cm depths increased 36-60\% in elevated CO2. Differences from 30 cm depth and below were still increasing after 10 years' exposure to elevated CO2, with soil CO2 concentrations {$>$}10000 microL/L higher at 70- and 100-cm depths, potentially influencing soil acidity and rates of weathering. Soil solution Ca2+ and total base cation concentrations were 140\% and 176\% greater, respectively, in elevated CO2 at 200 cm depth. Similar increases were observed for soil-solution conductivity and alkalinity at 200 cm in elevated CO2. Overall, the effect of elevated CO2 belowground shows no sign of diminishing after more than a decade of CO2 enrichment.},

After six months exposure to elevated CO2, root production measured by root in-growth bags, showed significant increases in mean total root length and biomass, which were more than 100\% greater compared to the ambient treatment. This increased root length may have lead to a more intensive soil exploration. Chemical analysis of the roots showed that the roots in the elevated treatment accumulated more starch and had a lower C/N-ratio. Specific root respiration rates were significantly higher in the elevated treatment and this was probably attributed to increased nitrogen concentrations in the roots. Rhizospheric respiration and soil CO2 efflux were also enhanced in the elevated treatment. These results clearly indicate that under elevated atmospheric CO2 root production and development in Scots pine seedlings is altered and respiratory carbon losses through the root system are increased.},

The subsequent increase in C uptake was allocated primarily to tissues with limited longevity (needles and fine roots), which explains why the measured annual increment in woody biomass did not differ between CO2 treatments. Thus, our results suggest that accelerated stem growth only occurs in the first 2 years in the presence of elevated [CO2] and that forest rotations will not be shortened significantly in response to increasing [CO2]. In elevated [CO2], a higher proportion of available C was allocated below ground, resulting in altered biomass distribution patterns. In trees of equal size, measured ratios of fine root/needle biomass and belowground/aboveground biomass were almost twice as large in the elevated [CO2] treatment. Although there are uncertainties in scaling from saplings to mature canopies, the data indicate that, in nutrient-limited Scots pine forests, elevated [CO2] is unlikely to accelerate tree growth significantly, but is likely to increase C inputs to soil.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide enrichment (eCO2) can enhance plant carbon uptake and growth1--5, thereby providing an important negative feedback to climate change by slowing the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration6. Although evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong CO2 fertilization effect on biomass growth3--5, it is unclear whether mature forests respond to eCO2 in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands7--10, photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO2 without any apparent accompanying growth response, leaving the fate of additional carbon fixed under eCO2 unclear4,5,7--11. Here using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest responded to four years of eCO2 exposure. We show that, although the eCO2 treatment of +150 parts per million (+38 per cent) above ambient levels induced a 12 per cent (+247 grams of carbon per square metre per year) increase in carbon uptake through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, with increased soil respiration alone accounting for half of the total uptake surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO2, and challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on ubiquitous CO2 fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in global forests.},

Based upon the literature, it was hypothesized that both elevated CO2 and N would cause increased root biomass which would in turn cause increases in both total soil CO2 efflux and microbial respiration. This hypothesis was only supported in part: both CO2 and N treatments caused significant increases in root biomass, soil pCO2, and calculated CO2 efflux, but there were no differences in soil microbial respiration measured in the laboratory. Both correlative and quantitative comparisons of CO2 efflux rates indicated that microbial respiration contributes little to total soil CO2 efflux in the field. Measurements of soil pCO2 and calculated CO2 efflux provided inexpensive, non-invasive, and relatively sensitive indices of belowground response to CO2 and N treatments.},

  abstract = {The effects of elevated CO2 on nutrient cycling and selected belowground processes in the closed-canopy sweetgum plantation were assessed as part of a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We hypothesized that nitrogen (N) constraints to growth response to elevated CO2 would be mitigated primarily by reduced tissue concentrations (resulting in increased biomass production per unit uptake) rather than increased uptake. Conversely, we hypothesized that the constraints of other nutrients to growth response to elevated CO2 would be mitigated primarily by increased uptake because of adequate soil supplies. The first hypothesis was not supported: although elevated CO2 caused reduced foliar N concentrations, it also resulted in increased uptake and requirement of N, primarily because of greater root turnover. The additional N uptake with elevated CO2 constituted between 10 and 40\% of the estimated soil mineralizeable N pool. The second hypothesis was largely supported: elevated CO2 had no significant effects on tissue concentrations of P, K, Ca, or Mg and caused significantly increased uptake and requirement of K, Ca, and Mg. Soil exchangeable pools of these nutrients are large and should pose no constraint to continued growth responses. Elevated CO2 also caused increased microbial biomass, reduced N leaching and increased P leaching from O horizons (measured by resin lysimeters), reduced soil solution NH4+, SO42-, and Ca2+ concentrations, and increased soil solution pH. There were no statistically significant treatment effects on soil nutrient availability as measured by resin capsules, resin stakes, or in situ incubations. Despite significantly lower litterfall N concentrations in the elevated CO2 treatment, there were no significant treatment effects on translocation or forest floor biomass or nutrient contents. There were also no significant treatment effects on the rate of decomposition of fine roots. In general, the effects of elevated CO2 on nutrient cycling in this study were not large; future constraints on growth responses imposed by N limitations will depend on changes in N demand, atmospheric N deposition, and soil mineralization rates.},

Wood chemistry was studied also on paper birch (               Betula papyrifera               Marsh.) and sugar maple (               Acer saccharum               Marsh.) seedling-origin saplings of the same age. Material for the study was collected from the Aspen Free-Air CO               2               Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Rhinelander, WI, USA, where the saplings had been exposed to four treatments: control (C; ambient CO               2               , ambient O               3               ), elevated CO               2               (560{$\quad$}ppm during daylight hours), elevated O               3               (1.5 {\texttimes} ambient during daylight hours) and their combination (CO               2               +O               3               ) for three growing seasons (1998--2000). Wood chemistry responses to the elevated CO               2               and O               3               treatments differed between species. Aspen was most responsive, while maple was the least responsive of the three tree species. Aspen genotype affected the responses of wood chemistry and, to some extent, wood structure to the treatments. The lignin concentration increased under elevated O               3               in four clones of aspen and in birch. However, elevated CO               2               ameliorated the effect. In two aspen clones, nitrogen in wood samples decreased under combined exposure to CO               2               and O               3               . Soluble sugar concentration in one aspen clone and starch concentration in two clones were increased by elevated CO               2               . In aspen wood,               {$\alpha$}               -cellulose concentration changed under elevated CO               2               , decreasing under ambient O               3               and slightly increasing under elevated O               3               . Hemicellulose concentration in birch was decreased by elevated CO               2               and increased by elevated O               3               . In aspen, elevated O               3               induced statistically significant reductions in distance from the pith to the bark and vessel lumen diameter, as well as increased wall thickness and wall percentage, and in one clone, decreased fibre lumen diameter. Our results show that juvenile wood properties of broadleaves, depending on species and genotype, were altered by atmospheric gas concentrations predicted for the year 2050 and that CO               2               ameliorates some adverse effects of elevated O               3               on wood chemistry.},

However, we know little about how climate change-induced alterations in biomass production affect plant species composition. To better understand how climate change will alter both individual plant species and community biomass, we manipulated atmospheric [CO               2               ], air temperature, and precipitation in a constructed old-field ecosystem. Specifically, we compared the responses of dominant and subdominant species to our climatic treatments, and explored how changes in plant dominance patterns alter community evenness over 2 years. Our study resulted in four major findings: (1) all treatments, elevated [CO               2               ], warming, and increased precipitation increased plant community biomass and the effects were additive rather than interactive, (2) plant species differed in their response to the treatments, resulting in shifts in the proportional biomass of individual species, which altered the plant community composition; however, the plant community response was largely driven by the positive precipitation response of               Lespedeza               , the most dominant species in the community, (3) precipitation explained most of the variation in plant community composition among treatments, and (4) changes in precipitation caused a shift in the dominant species proportional biomass that resulted in lower community evenness in the wet relative to dry treatments. Interestingly, compositional and evenness responses of the subdominant community to the treatments did not always follow the responses of the whole plant community. Our data suggest that changes in plant dominance patterns and community evenness are an important part of community responses to climatic change, and generally, that such compositional shifts can alter ecosystem biomass production and nutrient inputs.},

These two gases act in opposing ways, and even at low concentrations (1{$\cdot$}5 {\texttimes} ambient, with ambient averaging 34--36 nL L-1 during the summer daylight hours), O3 offsets or moderates the responses induced by elevated CO2. 3 After 3 years of exposure to 560 {\textmu}mol mol-1 CO2, the above-ground volume of Aspen stands was 40\% above those grown at ambient CO2, and there was no indication of a diminishing growth trend. In contrast, O3 at 1{$\cdot$}5 {\texttimes} ambient completely offset the growth enhancement by CO2, both for O3-sensitive and O3-tolerant clones. Implications of this finding for carbon sequestration, plantations to reduce excess CO2, and global models of forest productivity and climate change are presented.},

  abstract = {Over time, the stimulative effect of elevated CO2 on the photosynthesis of rice crops is likely to be reduced with increasing duration of CO2 exposure, but the resultant effects on crop productivity remain unclear. To investigate seasonal changes in the effect of elevated CO2 on the growth of rice (Oryza sativa L.) crops, a free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment was conducted at Shizukuishi, Iwate, Japan in 1998--2000. The target CO2 concentration of the FACE plots was 200 {\textmu}mol mol-1 above that of ambient. Three levels of nitrogen (N) were supplied: low (LN, 4 g N m-2), medium [MN, 8 (1998) and 9 (1999, 2000) g N m-2] and high N (HN, 12 and 15 g N m-2). For MN and HN but not for LN, elevated CO2 increased tiller number at panicle initiation (PI) but this positive response decreased with crop development. As a result, the response of green leaf area index (GLAI) to elevated CO2 greatly varied with development, showing positive responses during vegetative stages and negative responses after PI. Elevated CO2 decreased leaf N concentration over the season, except during early stage of development. For MN crops, total biomass increased with elevated CO2, but the response declined linearly with development, with average increases of 32, 28, 21, 15 and 12\% at tillering, PI, anthesis, mid-ripening and grain maturity, respectively. This decline is likely to be due to decreases in the positive effects of elevated CO2 on canopy photosynthesis because of reductions in both GLAI and leaf N. Up to PI, LN-crops tended to have a lower response to elevated CO2 than MN- and HN-crops, though by final harvest the total biomass response was similar for all N levels. For MN- and HN-crops, the positive response of grain yield (ca. 15\%) to elevated CO2 was slightly greater than the response of final total biomass while for LN-crops it was less. We conclude that most of the seasonal changes in crop response to elevated CO2 are directly or indirectly associated with N uptake.},

Most studies focused principally on the overstory trees with little attention given to understory vegetation. Despite its small contribution to total productivity of an ecosystem, understory vegetation plays an important role in predicting successional dynamics and future plant community composition. Thus, the response of understory vegetation in Pinus taeda plantation at the Duke Forest FACE site after 15--17 years of exposure to elevated CO2, 6--13 of which with nitrogen (N) amendment, was examined. Aboveground biomass and density of the understory decreased across all treatments with increasing overstory leaf area index (LAI). However, the CO2 and N treatments had no effect on aboveground biomass, tree density, community composition, and the fraction of shade-tolerant species. The increases of overstory LAI ( 28\%) under elevated CO2 resulted in a reduction of light available to the understory ( 18\%) sufficient to nullify the expected growth-enhancing effect of elevated CO2 on understory vegetation.},

Therefore, a long-term CO2-enrichment experiment on sour orange trees was started in 1987, and the final results after 17 years are reported herein. Four sour orange trees (Citrus aurantium L.) were grown from seedling stage at 300 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 CO2 above ambient in open-top, clear-plastic-wall chambers at Phoenix, AZ. Four control trees were similarly grown at ambient CO2. All trees were supplied ample water and nutrients comparable with a commercial orchard. After a peak 2--4 years into the experiment, there was a productivity plateau at about a 70\% enhancement of annual fruit and incremental wood production over the last several years of the experiment. When summed over the duration of the experiment, there was an overall enhancement of 70\% of total biomass production. Much of the enhancement came from greater numbers of fruits produced, with no change in fruit size. Thicker trunks and branches and more branches and roots were produced, but the root/shoot ratio was unaffected. Also, there was almost no change in the elemental composition of the biomass produced, perhaps in part due to the minimal responsiveness of root-symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to the treatment.},

More than 50 scientists participated, and they collected a large and varied set of data on plant, soil, and microclimatic responses to the elevated CO2 and its interactions with the water and N treatments. The dataset has been popular with wheat growth modelers who have utilized the growth, yield, and other data to validate their models, which get used to predict likely future wheat productivity with projected global change. The dataset assembled herein contains many of these data, including management, soils, weather, physiology, phenology, biomass growth, leaf area, yield, quality, canopy temperatures, energy balance, soil moisture, nitrogen assimilation, and other data.},

  abstract = {The direct and indirect effects of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on plant nitrogen (N) content were studied in a shortgrass steppe ecosystem in northeastern Colorado, USA. Beginning in 1997 nine experimental plots were established: three open-top chambers with ambient CO2 levels (approximately 365 {$\mu$}mol mol-1), three open-top chambers with twice-ambient CO2 levels (approximately 720 {$\mu$}mol mol-1), and three unchambered control plots. After 3 years of growing-season CO2 treatment, the aboveground N concentration of plants grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 decreased, and the carbon--nitrogen (C:N) ratio increased. At the same time, increased aboveground biomass production under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions increased the net transfer of N out of the soil of elevated-CO2 plots. Aboveground biomass production after simulated herbivory was also greater under elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2. Surprisingly, no significant changes in belowground plant tissue N content were detected in response to elevated CO2. Measurements of individual species at peak standing phytomass showed significant effects of CO2 treatment on aboveground plant tissue N concentration and significant differences between species in N concentration, suggesting that changes in species composition under elevated CO2 will contribute to overall changes in nutrient cycling. Changes in plant N content, driven by changes in aboveground plant N concentration, could have important consequences for biogeochemical cycling rates and the long-term productivity of the shortgrass steppe as atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase.},

Site-specific allometric equations were applied to annual nondestructive growth measurements to estimate above- and below-ground biomass and NPP for each year of the experiment. {$\bullet$} Relative to the control, elevated CO 2 increased total biomass 25, 45 and 60\% in the aspen, aspen-birch and aspen-maple communities, respectively. Tropospheric O 3 caused 23, 13 and 14\% reductions in total biomass relative to the control in the respective communities. Combined fumigation resulted in total biomass response of - 7.8, +8.4 and +24.3\% relative to the control in the aspen, aspen-birch and aspen- sugar maple communities, respectively. {$\bullet$} These results indicate that exposure to even moderate levels of O 3 significantly reduce the capacity of NPP to respond to elevated CO 2 in some forests.},

  abstract = {1 This research was conducted at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) site located in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. where trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) trees were exposed to one of four atmospheric treatments: elevated carbon dioxide (CO2; 560 {\textmu}L/L), elevated ozone (O3; ambient {\texttimes} 1.5), elevated CO2 and O3, or ambient air. We evaluated the effects of these fumigants on aspen foliar quality and the performance of aspen blotch leafminer (Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella Braun). 2 CO2 and O3 each affected foliar quality, with the major changes consisting of an 11\% reduction in nitrogen under elevated CO2 and a 20\% reduction in tremulacin under elevated O3. In the CO2 + O3 treatment, nitrogen levels were reduced by 15\% and CO2 ameliorated the O3-mediated reduction in tremulacin levels. 3 Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella were allowed to colonize trees naturally. Elevated CO2 and O3 reduced colonization rates by 42 and 49\% relative to ambient CO2 and O3, respectively. The only effect of fumigation treatments on larval performance occurred under elevated O3, where male development time and larval consumption increased by 8 and 28\%, respectively, over insects reared under ambient O3. 4 These data demonstrate that the individual and combined effects of CO2 and O3 can alter aspen foliar chemistry and that these alterations in foliar chemistry produce little to no change in larval performance. However, both CO2 and O3 greatly reduced oviposition. In order to ascertain the full effects of CO2 and O3 on insect performance, future studies should address both population- and individual-level characteristics.},

  abstract = {Background and aimsThe response of soil respiration (SR) to elevated CO2 is driven by a number of processes and feedbacks. This work aims to i) detect the effect of elevated CO2 on soil respiration during the second rotation of a short rotation forest, at two levels of N availability; and ii) identify the main drivers behind any changes in soil respiration.MethodsA poplar plantation (POP-EUROFACE) was grown for two rotations of 3~years under elevated CO2 maintained by a FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) technique. Root biomass, litter production and soil respiration were followed for two consecutive years after coppice.ResultsIn the plantation, the stimulation of fine root and litter production under elevated CO2 observed at the beginning of the rotation declined over time. Soil respiration (SR) was continuously stimulated by elevated CO2, with a much larger enhancement during the growing (up to 111~\%) than in the dormant season (40~\%). The SR increase at first appeared to be due to the increase in fine root biomass, but at the end of the 2nd rotation was supported by litter decomposition and the availability of labile C. Soil respiration increase under elevated CO2 was not affected by N availability.ConclusionsThe stimulation of SR by elevated CO2 was sustained by the decomposition of above and belowground litter and by the greater availability of easily decomposable substrates into the soil. In the final year as elevated CO2 did not increase C allocation to roots, the higher SR suggests greater C losses from the soil, thus reducing the potential for C accumulation.},

  abstract = {Global environmental changes, such as rising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, have a wide range of direct effects on plant physiology, growth, and fecundity. These environmental changes also can affect plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species. Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO(2) concentration and amounts of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated CO(2) (eCO(2)) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and (2) how predicted changes in CO(2) concentration affect plant resistance to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We found no evidence that CO(2) altered resistance, but plants grown in eCO(2) were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22\%, respectively, when plants were reared under eCO(2), but plants fully compensated for clipping in ambient CO(2) (aCO(2)) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO(2) but not aCO(2) environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance in eCO(2) environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness effects of clipping in predicted future eCO(2) conditions. Thus, environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions.},

These ecological effects may be accompanied by evolutionary change if elevated CO2 (eCO2) alters patterns of natural selection or expression of genetic variation. Here, a statistically powerful quantitative genetic experiment and manipulations of CO2 concentrations in a field setting were used to investigate how eCO2 impacts patterns of selection on ecologically important traits in Arabidopsis thaliana; heritabilities, which influence the rate of response to selection; and genetic covariances between traits, which may constrain responses to selection. CO2 had strong phenotypic effects; plants grown in eCO2 were taller and produced more biomass and fruits. Also, significant directional selection was observed on many traits and significant genetic variation was observed for all traits. However, no evolutionary effect of eCO2 was detected; patterns of selection, heritabilities and genetic correlations corresponded closely in ambient and elevated CO2 environments. The data suggest that patterns of natural selection and the quantitative genetic parameters of this A. thaliana population are robust to increases in CO2 concentration and that responses to eCO2 will be primarily ecological.},

However, C4 photosynthesis is usually saturated at current [CO2] and theoretically should not be stimulated under elevated [CO2]. Nevertheless, some controlled environment studies have reported direct stimulation of C4 photosynthesis and productivity, as well as physiological acclimation, under elevated [CO2]. To test if these effects occur in the open air and within the Corn Belt, maize (Zea mays) was grown in ambient [CO2] (376 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) and elevated [CO2] (550 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) using Free-Air Concentration Enrichment technology. The 2004 season had ideal growing conditions in which the crop did not experience water stress. In the absence of water stress, growth at elevated [CO2] did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass, or yield. Nor was there any CO2 effect on the activity of key photosynthetic enzymes, or metabolic markers of carbon and nitrogen status. Stomatal conductance was lower (-34\%) and soil moisture was higher (up to 31\%), consistent with reduced crop water use. The results provide unique field evidence that photosynthesis and production of maize may be unaffected by rising [CO2] in the absence of drought. This suggests that rising [CO2] may not provide the full dividend to North American maize production anticipated in projections of future global food supply.},

  abstract = {If long-term responses of photosynthesis and leaf diffusive conductance to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are similar or predictably different among species, functional types, and ecosystem types, general global models of elevated CO2 effects can effectively be developed. To address this issue we measured gas exchange rates of 13 perennial grassland species from four functional groups across 11 years of long-term free-air CO2 enrichment (eCO2, +180 ppm above ambient CO2) in the BioCON experiment in Minnesota, USA. Eleven years of eCO2 produced consistent but modest increases in leaf net photosynthetic rates of 10\% on average compared with plants grown at ambient CO2 concentrations across the 13 species. This eCO2-induced enhancement did not depend on soil N treatment, is much less than the average across other longer-term studies, and represents strong acclimation (i.e. downregulation) as it is also much less than the instantaneous response to eCO2. The legume and C3 nonlegume forb species were the most responsive among the functional groups (+13\% in each), the C4 grasses the least responsive (+4\%), and C3 grasses intermediate in their photosynthetic response to eCO2 across years (+9\%). Leaf stomatal conductance and nitrogen content declined comparably across species in eCO2 compared with ambient CO2 and to degrees corresponding to results from other studies. The significant acclimation of photosynthesis is explained in part by those eCO2-induced decreases in leaf N content and stomatal conductance that reduce leaf photosynthetic capacity in plants grown under elevated compared with ambient CO2 concentrations. Results of this study, probably the longest-term with the most species, suggest that carbon cycle models that assume and thereby simulate long-lived strong eCO2 stimulation of photosynthesis (e.g.{$>$} 25\%) for all of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems should be viewed with a great deal of caution.},

However, we are not aware of any studies where the capacity of models to simulate intra- and inter-annual variation in responses to elevated CO2 has been tested against long-term experimental data. Here we tested how well the ecosystem model APSIM/AgPasture was able to simulate the results from a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment on grazed pasture. At this FACE site, during 11 years of CO2 enrichment, a wide range in annual plant production response to CO2 (-6 to +28\%) was observed. As well as running the full model, which includes three plant CO2 response functions (plant photosynthesis, nitrogen (N) demand and stomatal conductance), we also tested the influence of these three functions on model predictions. Model/data comparisons showed that: (i) overall the model over-predicted the mean annual plant production response to CO2 (18.5\% cf 13.1\%) largely because years with small or negative responses to CO2 were not well simulated; (ii) in general seasonal and inter-annual variation in plant production responses to elevated CO2 were well represented by the model; (iii) the observed CO2 enhancement in overall mean legume content was well simulated but year-to-year variation in legume content was poorly captured by the model; (iv) the best fit of the model to the data required all three CO2 response functions to be invoked; (v) using actual legume content and reduced N fixation rate under elevated CO2 in the model provided the best fit to the experimental data. We conclude that in temperate grasslands the N dynamics (particularly the legume content and N fixation activity) play a critical role in pasture production responses to elevated CO2, and are processes for model improvement.},

Comparison of LAIoptical with LAI estimates from litter collections and from allometric relationships showed considerable differences. The increase in biomass in response to FACE was caused by an initial stimulation of absolute and relative growth rates, which disappeared after the first growing season following coppicing. An ontogenetic decline in growth in the FACE treatment, together with strong competition inside the dense plantation, may have caused this decrease. Fertilization did not influence aboveground growth, although some FACE responses were more pronounced in fertilized trees. A species effect was observed for most parameters.},

Here, we report the likely impact of future increases in atmospheric CO2 on woody biomass production of three poplar species (Populus alba L. clone 2AS-11, Populus nigra L. clone Jean Pourtet and Populus{\texttimes}euramericana clone I-214). Trees were growing in a high-density coppice plantation during the second rotation (i.e., regrowth after coppice; 2002--2004; POPFACE/EUROFACE). Six plots were studied, half of which were continuously fumigated with CO2 (FACE; free air carbon dioxide enrichment of 550 ppm). Half of each plot was fertilized to study the interaction between CO2 and nutrient fertilization. At the end of the second rotation, selective above- and belowground harvests were performed to estimate the productivity of this bio-energy plantation. Fertilization did not affect growth of the poplar trees, which was likely because of the high rates of fertilization during the previous agricultural land use. In contrast, elevated CO2 enhanced biomass production by up to 29\%, and this stimulation did not differ between above- and belowground parts. The increased initial stump size resulting from elevated CO2 during the first rotation (1999--2001) could not solely explain the observed final biomass increase. The larger leaf area index after canopy closure and the absence of any major photosynthetic acclimation after 6 years of fumigation caused the sustained CO2-induced biomass increase after coppice. These results suggest that, under future CO2 concentrations, managed poplar coppice systems may exhibit higher potential for C sequestration and, thus, help mitigate climate change when used as a source of C-neutral energy.},

Additionally, responses to elevated [CO2] might depend on the nutrient availability and the light environment, affecting the net carbon uptake of a forest stand. After 6 yr of exposure to free-air CO2 enrichment (EUROFACE) during two rotation cycles (with fertilization during the second cycle), profiles of light, leaf characteristics and photosynthetic parameters were measured in the closed canopy of a poplar (Populus) short-rotation coppice. Net photosynthetic rate (A(growth)) was 49\% higher in poplars grown in elevated [CO2], independently of the canopy position. Jmax significantly increased (15\%), whereas leaf carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), leaf nitrogen (N(a)) and chlorophyll (Chl(a)) were unaffected in elevated [CO2]. Leaf mass per unit area (LMA) increased in the upper canopy. Fertilization created more leaves in the top of the crown. These results suggest that the photosynthetic stimulation by elevated [CO2] in a closed-canopy poplar coppice might be sustained in the long term. The absence of any down-regulation, given a sufficient sink capacity and nutrient availability, provides more carbon for growth and storage in this bioenergy plantation.},

Here, we summarize the responses of a poplar (               Populus               ) plantation to 6 yr of free air CO               2               enrichment (POP/EUROFACE consisting of two rotation cycles). We show that a poplar plantation growing in nonlimiting light, nutrient and water conditions will significantly increase its productivity in elevated CO               2               concentrations ([CO               2               ]). Increased biomass yield resulted from an early growth enhancement and photosynthesis did not acclimate to elevated [CO               2               ]. Sufficient nutrient availability, increased nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and the large sink capacity of poplars contributed to the sustained increase in C uptake over 6 yr. Additional C taken up in high [CO               2               ] was mainly invested into woody biomass pools. Coppicing increased yield by 66\% and partly shifted the extra C uptake in elevated [CO               2               ] to above-ground pools, as fine root biomass declined and its [CO               2               ] stimulation disappeared. Mineral soil C increased equally in ambient and elevated [CO               2               ] during the 6~yr experiment. However, elevated [CO               2               ] increased the stabilization of C in the mineral soil. Increased productivity of a poplar SRC in elevated [CO               2               ] may allow shorter rotation cycles, enhancing the viability of SRC for biofuel production.},

We assessed the independent and interactive effects of CO2 and O3 fumigation on foliar chemistry of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) at a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility in northern Wisconsin. Leaf samples were collected at five time periods during a single growing season, and analyzed for nitrogen. starch and condensed tannin concentrations, nitrogen resorption efficiencies (NREs), and C:N ratios. Enriched CO2 reduced foliar nitrogen concentrations in aspen and birch; O3 only marginally reduced nitrogen concentrations. NREs were unaffected by pollution treatment in aspen, declined with 03 exposure in birch, and this decline was ameliorated by enriched CO2. C:N ratios of abscised leaves increased in response to enriched CO2 in both tree species. O3 did not significantly alter C:N ratios in aspen, although values tended to be higher in + CO2 + O3 leaves. For birch, O3 decreased C:N ratios under ambient CO2 and increased C:N ratios under elevated CO2. Thus, under the combined pollutants, the C:N ratios of both aspen and birch leaves were elevated above the averaged responses to the individual and independent trace gas treatments. Starch concentrations were largely unresponsive to CO2 and O3 treatments in aspen. but increased in response to elevated CO2 in birch. Levels of condensed tannins were negligibly affected by CO2 and O3 treatments in aspen, but increased in response to enriched CO2 in birch. Results from this work suggest that changes in foliar chemical composition elicited by enriched CO2 are likely to impact herbivory and decomposition, whereas the effects of O3 are likely to be minor, except in cases where they influence plant response to CO2.},

We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of atmospheric CO2 and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) genotype on chemical composition of foliage and performance of the whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma J. E. Sm.). 2 This research was conducted at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) site in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. Leaf samples were collected periodically from each of three genetically variable aspen genotypes growing under ambient and elevated CO2, and analysed for levels of primary and secondary metabolites. Tussock moth larvae were reared in situ on experimental trees, and development times and pupal masses were recorded. 3 Foliar chemical composition varied among aspen genotypes and in response to CO2 enrichment. However, chemical responses of trees to elevated CO2 were generally consistent across genotypes. 4 Larval development times varied among host genotypes and increased slightly for insects on high-CO2 plants. Enriched CO2 tended to reduce insect pupal masses, particularly for females on one of the three aspen genotypes. 5 CO2 {\texttimes} genotype interactions observed for plant chemistry and insect performance in this study with a small number of genotypes are probably too few, and too weak, to shift selection pressures in aspen populations. These results differ, however, from earlier work in which more substantial CO2 {\texttimes} genotype interactions were observed for plant chemistry.},

Thus, effectively and ineffectively nodulating lucerne (               Medicago sativa               L.) plants with a very similar genetic background were grown in competition with each other on fertile soil in the Swiss FACE experiment in order to monitor their CO               2               response. Under elevated atmospheric pCO               2               , effectively nodulating lucerne, thus capable of symbiotically fixing N               2               , strongly increased the harvestable biomass and the N yield, independent of N fertilization. In contrast, the harvestable biomass and N yield of ineffectively nodulating plants were affected negatively by elevated atmospheric pCO               2               when N fertilization was low. Large amounts of N fertilizer enabled the plants to respond more favourably to elevated atmospheric pCO               2               , although not as strongly as effectively nodulating plants. The CO               2               -induced increase in N yield of the effectively nodulating plants was attributed solely to an increase in symbiotic N               2               fixation of 50--175\%, depending on the N fertilization treatment. N yield derived from the uptake of mineral N from the soil was, however, not affected by elevated pCO               2               . This result demonstrates that, in fertile soil and under temperate climatic conditions, symbiotic N               2               fixation               per se               is responsible for the considerably greater amount of above-ground biomass and the higher N yield under elevated atmospheric pCO               2               . This supports the assumption that symbiotic N               2               fixation plays a key role in maintaining the C/N balance in terrestrial ecosystems in a CO               2               -rich world.},

Standing root biomass, fine root turnover and mycorrhizal colonization of the following Populus species was examined: Populus alba L., Populus nigra L., Populus x euramericana Dode (Guinier). Elevated CO2 increased belowground allocation of biomass in all three species examined, standing root biomass increased by 47--76\% as a result of FACE treatment. Similarly, fine root biomass present in the soil increased by 35--84\%. The FACE treatment resulted in 55\% faster fine root turnover in P. alba and a 27\% increase in turnover of roots of P. nigra and P. x euramericana. P. alba and P. nigra invested more root biomass into deeper soil horizon under elevated CO2. Response of the mycorrhizal community to elevated CO2 was more varied, the rate of infection increased only in P. alba for both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). The roots of P. nigra showed greater infection only by AM and the colonization of the root system of P. x euramericana was not affected by FACE treatment. The results suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions induce greater belowground biomass investment, which could lead to accumulation of assimilated C in the soil profile. This may have implications for C sequestration and must be taken into account when considering long-term C storage in the soil.},

Measurements of needle length (L), mass per unit area (LMA), N concentration (N(l)) on a mass and an area basis, light-saturated net photosynthesis per unit leaf area (A(a)) and per unit mass (A(m)), and leaf conductance (g(L)) began after the second fertilizer application in existing 1-year-old foliage (F(O)) and later in developing current-year first-flush (F(C1)) and current-year second-flush (F(C2)) foliage. Elevated [CO(2)] increased A(a) by 43 and 52\% in F(O) and F(C1) foliage, respectively, but generally had no significant effect on any other parameter. Fertilization had little or no significant effect on L, LMA, A or g(L) in F(O) foliage; although N(l) was significantly higher in fertilized trees by midsummer. In contrast, fertilization resulted in large increases in L, N(l), and A in F(C1) and F(C2) foliage, increasing A(a) by about 20\%. These results suggest that, although both needle age classes accumulate N following fertilization, they use it differently-current-year foliage incorporates N into photosynthetic machinery, whereas 1-year-old foliage serves as an N store. There were no significant interaction effects of elevated [CO(2)] and fertilization on A. Elevated [CO(2)] increased the intercept of the A:N(l) relationship but did not significantly affect the slope of the relationship in either foliage age class.},

Here the results from 4 years' physiology and production studies in the field are presented. In a species-rich semi-natural grassland in central Sweden open-top chambers were used to study the effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentration (twice the ambient level) on plant production, physiology and species composition. The first three growing seasons showed a 30--60\% increase in above-ground biomass at harvest under elevated CO2. During the fourth year there was no difference in above-ground biomass between the treatments. For all years, leaf-level photosynthesis for measured species was 30--60\% higher and stomatal conductance 20--40\% lower at elevated CO2 than at ambient. Nitrogen concentration in stems and leaves was 5--20\% lower at elevated CO2. Specific leaf area (SLA) did not show any response to elevated CO2. The variation in the effect of CO2 on above-ground production was attributed to variation in water stress, with low water stress (high precipitation) giving the least effect. It is concluded that even in this relatively low-production system CO2 effects can persist for at least several years and even increase.},

Live fine root mass (LFR) showed less seasonal variation than dead fine root mass (DFR), which was correlated with seasonal changes in soil moisture and soil temperature. LFR mass increased significantly (by 86\%) in the elevated CO2 treatment, with an increment of 37 g(dry weight) m-2 above the control plots after two years of CO2 fumigation. There was no long-term increment in DFR associated with elevated CO2, but significant seasonal accumulations of DFR mass occurred during the summer of the second year of fumigation. Overall, root net primary production (RNPP) was not significantly different, but annual carbon inputs were 21.7 gC m-2 y-1 (68\%) higher in the elevated CO2 treatment compared to controls. Specific root respiration was not altered by the CO2 treatment during most of the year; however, it was significantly higher by 21\% and 13\% in September 1997 and May 1998, respectively, in elevated CO2. We did not find statistically significant differences in the C/N ratio of the root tissue, root decomposition or phosphatase activity in soil and roots associated with the treatment. Our data show that the early response of a loblolly pine forest ecosystem subject to CO2 enrichment is an increase in its fine root population and a trend towards higher total RNPP after two years of CO2 fumigation.},

Utilizing 10 yr of data from the Duke free-air CO(2) enrichment site, we evaluated the dynamics and distribution of plant C. *Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations, resulting in higher (up to 50\%) estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments. *Generally, elevated [CO(2)] caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C, but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools. Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its [CO(2)]-induced enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability, with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability. Consequently, [CO(2)]-induced net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30\% in different plots and years. *Through quantifying the effects of nutrient and water availability on the forest productivity response to elevated [CO(2)], we show that net primary productivity enhancement by elevated [CO(2)] is not uniform, but rather highly dependent on the availability of other growth resources.},

In this study, we investigated spring leaf flush and how long-term growth at elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO(2)]) and elevated ozone concentration ([O(3)]) altered leaf area index development in a closed Populus tremuloides (aspen) canopy. This work was done at the Aspen FACE experiment where aspen clones have been grown since 1997 in conditions simulating the [CO(2)] and [O(3)] predicted for approximately 2050. The responses of two clones were compared during the first month of spring leaf out when CO(2) fumigation had begun, but O(3) fumigation had not. Trees in elevated [CO(2)] plots showed a stimulation of leaf area index (36\%), while trees in elevated [O(3)] plots had lower leaf area index (-20\%). While individual leaf area was not significantly affected by elevated [CO(2)], the photosynthetic operating efficiency of aspen leaves was significantly improved (51\%). There were no significant differences in the way that the two aspen clones responded to elevated [CO(2)]; however, the two clones responded differently to long-term growth at elevated [O(3)]. The O(3)-sensitive clone, 42E, had reduced individual leaf area when grown at elevated [O(3)] (-32\%), while the tolerant clone, 216, had larger mature leaf area at elevated [O(3)] (46\%). These results indicate a clear difference between the two clones in their long-term response to elevated [O(3)], which could affect competition between the clones, and result in altered genotypic composition in future atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {It is uncertain whether elevated atmospheric CO2 will increase C storage in terrestrial ecosystems without concomitant increases in plant access to N. Elevated CO2 may alter microbial activities that regulate soil N availability by changing the amount or composition of organic substrates produced by roots. Our objective was to determine the potential for elevated CO2 to change N availability in an experimental plant-soil system by affecting the acquisition of root-derived C by soil microbes. We grew Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) cuttings for 2 years under two levels of atmospheric CO2 (36.7 and 71.5 Pa) and at two levels of soil N (210 and 970 {\textmu}g N g--1). Ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations were applied using open-top chambers, and soil N availability was manipulated by mixing soils differing in organic N content. From June to October of the second growing season, we measured midday rates of soil respiration. In August, we pulse-labeled plants with 14CO2 and measured soil 14CO2 respiration and the 14C contents of plants, soils, and microorganisms after a 6-day chase period. In conjunction with the August radio-labeling and again in October, we used 15N pool dilution techniques to measure in situ rates of gross N mineralization, N immobilization by microbes, and plant N uptake. At both levels of soil N availability, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant and root biomass, and marginally increased whole-plant N capital. Significant increases in soil respiration were closely linked to increases in root biomass under elevated CO2. CO2 enrichment had no significant effect on the allometric distribution of biomass or 14C among plant components, total 14C allocation belowground, or cumulative (6-day) 14CO2 soil respiration. Elevated CO2 significantly increased microbial 14C contents, indicating greater availability of microbial substrates derived from roots. The near doubling of microbial 14C contents at elevated CO2 was a relatively small quantitative change in the belowground C cycle of our experimental system, but represents an ecologically significant effect on the dynamics of microbial growth. Rates of plant N uptake during both 6-day periods in August and October were significantly greater at elevated CO2, and were closely related to fine-root biomass. Gross N mineralization was not affected by elevated CO2. Despite significantly greater rates of N immobilization under elevated CO2, standing pools of microbial N were not affected by elevated CO2, suggesting that N was cycling through microbes more rapidly. Our results contained elements of both positive and negative feedback hypotheses, and may be most relevant to young, aggrading ecosystems, where soil resources are not yet fully exploited by plant roots. If the turnover of microbial N increases, higher rates of N immobilization may not decrease N availability to plants under elevated CO2.},

Increases in root production of over 60\% were observed with elevated CO2 during years of intermediate levels of precipitation, with smaller effects in a very wet year and no effects in a very dry year. Aboveground to belowground production ratios, and the depth distribution of root production, did not differ between ambient and elevated CO2 treatments. Root soluble concentrations increased an average of 11\% and lignin concentrations decreased an average of 6\% with elevated CO2, while nitrogen concentrations decreased an average of 21\%. However, most tissue quality responses to CO2 varied greatly among years, and C:N ratios were higher in only one year (22 ambient vs. 33 elevated). Among years, root nitrogen concentrations declined with increasing aboveground plant nitrogen yield, and increased over the study period. Estimates of root production by the ingrowth donut method were much lower than previous estimates in the shortgrass steppe based on 14C decay. We discuss reasons why all ingrowth methods will always result in relative rather than absolute estimates of root production.},

  abstract = {Coupled surface-atmosphere models are being used with increased frequency to make predictions of tropospheric chemistry on a 'future' earth characterized by a warmer climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. One of the key inputs to these models is the emission of isoprene from forest ecosystems. Most models in current use rely on a scheme by which global change is coupled to changes in terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) which, in turn, is coupled to changes in the magnitude of isoprene emissions. In this study, we conducted measurements of isoprene emissions at three prominent global change experiments in the United States. Our results showed that growth in an atmosphere of elevated CO2 inhibited the emission of isoprene at levels that completely compensate for possible increases in emission due to increases in aboveground NPP. Exposure to a prolonged drought caused leaves to increase their isoprene emissions despite reductions in photosynthesis, and presumably NPP. Thus, the current generation of models intended to predict the response of isoprene emission to future global change probably contain large errors. A framework is offered as a foundation for constructing new isoprene emission models based on the responses of leaf biochemistry to future climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Six open-top chambers were installed on the shortgrass steppe in north-eastern Colorado, USA from late March until mid-October in 1997 and 1998 to evaluate how this grassland will be affected by rising atmospheric CO               2               . Three chambers were maintained at current CO               2               concentration (ambient treatment), three at twice ambient CO               2               , or approximately 720{$\quad\mu$}mol mol               -1               (elevated treatment), and three nonchambered plots served as controls. Above-ground phytomass was measured in summer and autumn during each growing season, soil water was monitored weekly, and leaf photosynthesis, conductance and water potential were measured periodically on important C               3               and C               4               grasses. Mid-season and seasonal above-ground productivity were enhanced from 26 to 47\% at elevated CO               2               , with no differences in the relative responses of C               3               /C               4               grasses or forbs. Annual above-ground phytomass accrual was greater on plots which were defoliated once in mid-summer compared to plots which were not defoliated during the growing season, but there was no interactive effect of defoliation and CO               2               on growth. Leaf photosynthesis was often greater in               Pascopyrum smithii               (C               3               ) and               Bouteloua gracilis               (C               4               ) plants in the elevated chambers, due in large part to higher soil water contents and leaf water potentials. Persistent downward photosynthetic acclimation in               P. smithii               leaves prevented large photosynthetic enhancement for elevated CO               2               -grown plants. Shoot N concentrations tended to be lower in grasses under elevated CO               2               , but only               Stipa comata               (C               3               ) plants exhibited significant reductions in N under elevated compared to ambient CO               2               chambers. Despite chamber warming of 2.6{$\quad^\circ$}C and apparent drier chamber conditions compared to unchambered controls, above-ground production in all chambers was always greater than in unchambered plots. Collectively, these results suggest increased productivity of the shortgrass steppe in future warmer, CO               2               enriched environments.},

  abstract = {The impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations has been studied in a number of field experiments, but little information exists on the response of semiarid rangelands to CO2, or on the consequences for forage quality. This study was initiated to study the CO2 response of the shortgrass steppe, an important semiarid grassland on the western edge of the North American Great Plains, used extensively for livestock grazing. The experiment was conducted for five years on native vegetation at the USDA-ARS Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado, USA. Three perennial grasses dominate the study site, Bouteloua gracilis, a C4 grass, and two C3 grasses, Pascopyrum smithii and Stipa comata. The three species comprise 88\% of the aboveground phytomass. To evaluate responses to rising atmospheric CO2, we utilized six open-top chambers, three with ambient air and three with air CO2 enriched to 720 {$\mu$}mol/mol, as well as three unchambered controls. We found that elevated CO2 enhanced production of the shortgrass steppe throughout the study, with 41\% greater aboveground phytomass harvested annually in elevated compared to ambient plots. The CO2-induced production response was driven by a single species, S. comata, and was due in part to greater seedling recruitment. The result was species movement toward a composition more typical of the mixed-grass prairie. Growth under elevated CO2 reduced the digestibility of all three dominant grass species. Digestibility was also lowest in the only species to exhibit a CO2-induced production enhancement, S. comata. The results suggest that rising atmospheric CO2 may enhance production of lower quality forage and a species composition shift toward a greater C3 component.},

Previous chamber studies of crops report large yield losses caused by elevation of tropospheric ozone, and have been the basis for projecting economic loss. This is the first study with a food crop (soybean, Glycine max) using free-air gas concentration enrichment (FACE) technology for ozone fumigation. A 23\% increase in ozone concentration from an average daytime ambient 56 p.p.b. to a treatment 69 p.p.b. over two growing seasons decreased seed yield by 20\%. Total above-ground net primary production decreased by 17\% without altering dry mass allocation among shoot organs, except seed. Fewer live leaves and decreased photosynthesis in late grain filling appear to drive the ozone-induced losses in production and yield. These results validate previous chamber studies suggesting that soybean yields will decrease under increasing ozone exposure. In fact, these results suggest that when treated under open-air conditions yield losses may be even greater than the large losses already reported in earlier chamber studies. Yield losses with elevated ozone were greater in the second year following a severe hailstorm, suggesting that losses caused by ozone might be exacerbated by extreme climatic events.},

During a 7-year experiment in a semi-arid grassland, the response of plant biomass to eCO2 and warming was largely regulated by interannual precipitation, while the response of plant community composition was more sensitive to experiment duration. The combined effects of eCO2 and warming on aboveground plant biomass were less positive in `wet' growing seasons, but total plant biomass was consistently stimulated by 25\% due to unique, supra-additive responses of roots. Independent of precipitation, the combined effects of eCO2 and warming on C3 graminoids became increasingly positive and supra-additive over time, reversing an initial shift toward C4 grasses. Soil resources also responded dynamically and non-additively to eCO2 and warming, shaping the plant responses. Our results suggest grasslands are poised for drastic changes in function and highlight the need for long-term, factorial experiments.},

The large positive effects of irrigation and elevated                     CO                     2                     alone on total root length were due to increases in both root length production and root life span. The increased total root length and life span under irrigation and elevated                     CO                     2                     coincided with apparent shifts from water limitation of plant growth to nitrogen limitation. Warming alone had minimal effects on root biomass, length and life span in this shallow soil layer. Warming and elevated                     CO                     2                     combined increased root biomass and total root length by                     c                     . 25\%, but total root length in this treatment was lower than expected if the effects of                     CO                     2                     and warming alone were additive. Treatment effects on total root length and root life span varied with soil depth and root diameter.

Thus, these root responses help explain previous observations of higher, and more stable, above-ground productivity in these projected climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to assess the photosynthetic responses of loblolly pine trees (Pinus taeda L.) during the first full growth season (1997) at the Brookhaven National Lab/Duke University Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Gas exchange, fluorescence characteristics, and leaf biochemistry of ambient CO2 (control) needles and ambient + 20 Pa CO2 (elevated) needles were examined five times during the year. The enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in mature loblolly pine trees varied across the season and was influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. Photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 was strongly correlated with leaf temperature. The magnitude of photosynthetic enhancement was zero in March but was as great as 52\% later in the season. In March, reduced sink demand and lower temperatures resulted in lower net photosynthesis, lower carboxylation rates and higher excess energy dissipation from the elevated CO2 needles than from control needles. The greatest photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 enrichment was observed in July during a period of high temperature and low precipitation, and in September during recovery from this period of low precipitation. In July, loblolly pine trees in the control rings exhibited lower net photosynthetic rates, lower maximum rates of photosynthesis at saturating CO2 and light, lower values of carboxylation and electron transport rates (modelled from A--Ci curves), lower total Rubisco activity, and lower photochemical quenching of fluorescence in comparison to other measurement periods. During this period of low precipitation trees in the elevated CO2 rings exhibited reduced net photosynthesis and photochemical quenching of fluorescence, but there was little effect on light- and CO2-saturated rates of photosynthesis, modelled rates of carboxylation or electron transport, or Rubisco activity. These first-year data will be used to compare with similar measurements from subsequent years of the FACE experiment in order to determine whether photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 occurs in these canopy loblolly pine trees growing in a forest ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The cycling of trace metals through terrestrial ecosystems is modulated by plant and soil processes. Changes in plant growth and function and soil properties associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) may therefore also affect the biological storage and stoichiometry of trace metals. We examined CO2 effects on a suite of metal micronutrients and contaminants in forest trees and soils at two free-air CO2 enrichment sites---a loblolly pine forest in North Carolina (Duke) and a sweetgum plantation in Tennessee [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]---and an open-top chamber experiment in a scrub-oak community in Florida [Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC)]. We found that CO2 effects on soil metals were variable across sites; there were significantly higher surface soil metal concentrations with CO2 enrichment at Duke and ORNL (P~{$<~$}0.05), but a trend of decreased soil metal concentrations at SERC (non-significant). These impacts on metals may be understood in the context of CO2 effects on soil organic matter (SOM); changes in percent SOM with CO2 enrichment were greatest at Duke (18\% increase), followed by ORNL (7\% increase), with limited effect at SERC (3\% increase). There were significant effects of elevated CO2 on foliar metal concentrations at all sites, but the response of foliar metals to CO2 enrichment varied by metal, among sites, and within sites based on plant species, canopy height, and leaf age. Contrary to expectations, we did not find an overall decline in foliar metal concentrations with CO2 enrichment, and some essential plant metals were greater under elevated CO2 (for example, 28\% increase in Mn across species and sites). Our results suggest that elevated CO2 impacts on trace metal biogeochemistry can be understood by accounting for both metal function (or lack thereof) in plants and the soil characteristics of the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that desert vegetation will show the strongest response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide due to strong water limitations in these systems that may be ameliorated by both photosynthetic enhancements and reductions in stomatal conductance. Here, we report the long-term effect of 55{$\quad$}Pa atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance for three Mojave Desert shrubs of differing leaf phenology (Ambrosia dumosa---drought-deciduous, Krameria erecta---winter-deciduous, Larrea tridentata---evergreen). The shrubs were growing in an undisturbed ecosystem fumigated using FACE technology and were measured over a four-year period that included both above and below-average precipitation. Daily integrated photosynthesis (Aday) was significantly enhanced by elevated CO2 for all three species, although Krameria erecta showed the greatest enhancements (63\% vs. 32\% for the other species) enhancements were constant throughout the entire measurement period. Only one species, Larrea tridentata, decreased stomatal conductance by 25--50\% in response to elevated CO2, and then only at the onset of the summer dry season and following late summer convective precipitation. Similarly, reductions in the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco were limited to Larrea during spring. These results suggest that the elevated CO2 response of desert vegetation is a function of complex interactions between species functional types and prevailing environmental conditions. Elevated CO2 did not extend the active growing season into the summer dry season because of overall negligible stomatal conductance responses that did not result in significant water conservation. Overall, we expect the greatest response of desert vegetation during years with above-average precipitation when the active growing season is not limited to {$\sim$}2{$\quad$}months and, consequently, the effects of increased photosynthesis can accumulate over a biologically significant time period.},

  abstract = {Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) generally increase primary production of terrestrial ecosystems. Production responses to elevated [CO2] may be particularly large in deserts, but information on their long-term response is unknown. We evaluated the cumulative effects of elevated [CO2] on primary production at the Nevada Desert FACE (free-air carbon dioxide enrichment) Facility. Aboveground and belowground perennial plant biomass was harvested in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem at the end of a 10-year elevated [CO2] experiment. We measured community standing biomass, biomass allocation, canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), carbon and nitrogen content, and isotopic composition of plant tissues for five to eight dominant species. We provide the first long-term results of elevated [CO2] on biomass components of a desert ecosystem and offer information on understudied Mojave Desert species. In contrast to initial expectations, 10 years of elevated [CO2] had no significant effect on standing biomass, biomass allocation, canopy cover, and C : N ratios of above- and belowground components. However, elevated [CO2] increased short-term responses, including leaf water-use efficiency (WUE) as measured by carbon isotope discrimination and increased plot-level LAI. Standing biomass, biomass allocation, canopy cover, and C : N ratios of above- and belowground pools significantly differed among dominant species, but responses to elevated [CO2] did not vary among species, photosynthetic pathway (C3 vs. C4), or growth form (drought-deciduous shrub vs. evergreen shrub vs. grass). Thus, even though previous and current results occasionally show increased leaf-level photosynthetic rates, WUE, LAI, and plant growth under elevated [CO2] during the 10-year experiment, most responses were in wet years and did not lead to sustained increases in community biomass. We presume that the lack of sustained biomass responses to elevated [CO2] is explained by inter-annual differences in water availability. Therefore, the high frequency of low precipitation years may constrain cumulative biomass responses to elevated [CO2] in desert environments.},

  abstract = {A decline in the availability of nitrogen (N) for plant growth (progressive nitrogen limitation or PNL) is a feedback that could constrain terrestrial ecosystem responses to elevated atmospheric CO2. Several long-term CO2 enrichment experiments have measured changes in plant and soil pools and fluxes consistent with PNL but evidence for PNL in grasslands is limited. In an 11~year Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment on grazed grassland we found the amount of N harvested in aboveground plant biomass was greater at elevated CO2 but declined over time to be indistinguishable from ambient after 5~years. Re-wetting after a major drought resulted in a large input of N from mineralisation and a return to a higher N harvested under elevated CO2 followed by a further decline. Over these two periods the amount of N in soil significantly increased at elevated CO2. Data from mesocosms introduced into the rings at intervals, and therefore having different lengths of exposure to CO2, showed plant N availability declined at elevated CO2 reaching a new equilibrium after 6~years of exposure. We conclude that the availability of N for plants in this grassland is dynamic but the underlying trend at elevated CO2 is for PNL.},

Leaf instantaneous light-saturated photosynthesis (PS) and leaf areas (A) were measured for all leaves of the current terminal, upper (current year) and the current-year increment of lower (1-year-old) lateral branches. An average, representative branch was chosen from each branch class. In addition, the average photosynthetic rate was estimated for the short-shoot leaves. A summing approach was used to estimate potential whole-plant C gain. The results of this method indicated that treatment differences were more pronounced at the plant- than at the leaf- or branch-level, because minor effects within modules accrued in scaling to plant level. The whole-plant response in C gain was determined by the counteracting changes in PS and A. For example, in the O3-sensitive clone (259), inhibition of PS in elevated O3 (at both ambient and elevated CO2) was partially ameliorated by an increase in total A. For the O3-tolerant clone (216), on the other hand, stimulation of photosynthetic rates in elevated CO2 was nullified by decreased total A.},

Elevated O(3) decreased leaf chlorophyll content and all photosynthetic parameters, particularly in the lower canopy, and the negative impact of O(3) increased through time.

  abstract = {The Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) hypothesis suggests that ecosystems in a CO2-enriched atmosphere will sequester C and N in long-lived biomass and soil organic pools, thereby limiting available N and constraining the continued response of net primary productivity to elevated [CO2]. Here, we present a six-year record of N dynamics of a sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to elevated [CO2] in the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We also evaluate the concept of PNL for this ecosystem from the perspective of N uptake, content, distribution, and turnover, and N-use efficiency. Leaf N content was 11\% lower on a leaf mass basis (NM) and 7\% lower on a leaf area basis (NA) in CO2-enriched trees. However, there was no effect of [CO2] on total canopy N content. Resorption of N during senescence was not altered by [CO2], so NM of litter, but not total N content, was reduced. The NM of fine roots was not affected, but the total amount of N required for fine-root production increased significantly, reflecting the large stimulation of fine-root production in this stand. Hence, total N requirement of the trees was higher in elevated [CO2], and the increased requirement was met through an increase in N uptake rather than increased retranslocation of stored reserves. Increased N uptake was correlated with increased net primary productivity (NPP). N-use efficiency, however, did not change with CO2 enrichment because increased N productivity was offset by lower mean residence time of N in the trees. None of the measured responses of plant N dynamics in this ecosystem indicated the occurrence of PNL, and the stimulation of NPP by elevated [CO2] was sustained for the first six years of the experiment. Although there are some indications of developing changes in the N economy, the N supply in the soil at this site may be sufficient to meet an increasing demand for available N, especially as the roots of CO2-enriched trees explore deeper in the soil profile.},

  abstract = {INCREASED forest growth in response to globally rising CO2 concentrations could provide an additional sink for the excess carbon added to the atmosphere from fossil fuels1,2. The response of trees to increased CO2, however, can be expected to be modified by the interactions of other environmental resources and stresses, higher-order ecological interactions and internal feedbacks inherent in the growth of large, perennial organisms3,4. To test whether short-term stimulation of tree growth by elevated CO2 can be sustained without inputs from other environmental resources, we grew yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) saplings for most of three growing seasons with continuous exposure to ambient or elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Despite a sustained increase in leaf-level photosynthesis and lower rates of foliar respiration in CO2-enriched trees, whole-plant carbon storage did not increase. The absence of a significant growth response is explained by changes in carbon allocation patterns, specifically a relative decrease in leaf production and an increase in fine root production. Although these compensatory responses reduced the potential increase in carbon storage in increased CO2 concentrations, they also favour the efficient use of resources over the longer term.},

Experiments with potted tree seedlings in growth chambers have been useful for defining the larger-scale issues pertaining to C-nutrient interactions in a forest. A general conclusion from many growth chamber studies is that belowground processes are especially sensitive to increased CO2 in the atmosphere. The belowground processes for which there is some evidence of a CO2 response include fine root production, symbiotic N2 fixation, mycorrhizal establishment, exudation, and rhizosphere microbial processes. Symbiotic N2 fixation is an important source of exogenous N in some forest systems and is a process that is highly dependent on the C cycle. If increased fine root production is at the expense of leaf production, changes in litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization could result.},

  abstract = {The prediction that litter quality, and hence litter decomposition rates, would be reduced when plants are grown in a CO2-enriched atmosphere has been based on the observation that foliar N concentrations usually are lower in elevated [CO2]. The implicit assumption is that the N concentration in leaf litter reflects the N concentration in green leaves. Here we evaluate that assumption by exploring whether the process of seasonal nutrient resorption is different in CO2-enriched plants. Nitrogen resorption was studied in two species of maple trees (Acer rubrum L. and A. saccharum Marsh.), which were planted in unfertilized soil and grown in open-top chambers with ambient or elevated [CO2] in combination with ambient or elevated temperature. In the second growing season, prior to autumn senescence, individual leaves were collected and analyzed for N and dry matter content. Other leaves at the same and an adjacent node were collected for analysis as they senesced and abscised. This data set was augmented with litter samples from the first growing season and with green leaves and leaf litter collected from white oak (Quercus alba L.) saplings grown in ambient and elevated [CO2] in open-top chambers. In chambers maintained at ambient temperature, CO2 enrichment reduced green leaf N concentrations by 25\% in A. rubrum and 19\% in A. saccharum. CO2 enrichment did not significantly reduce resorption efficiency so the N concentration also was reduced in litter. There were, however, few effects of [CO2] on N dynamics in these leaves; differences in N concentration usually were the result of increased dry matter content of leaves. The effects of elevated [CO2] on litter N are inherently more difficult to detect than differences in green leaves because factors that affect senescence and resorption increase variability. This is especially so when other environmental factors cause a disruption in the normal progress of resorption, such as in the first year when warming delayed senescence until leaves were killed by an early frost. The results of this experiment support the approach used in ecosystem models in which resorption efficiency is constant in ambient and elevated [CO2], but the results also indicate that other factors can alter resorption efficiency.},

  abstract = {A central question concerning the response of terrestrial ecosystems to a changing atmosphere is whether increased uptake of carbon in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results in greater plant biomass and carbon storage or, alternatively, faster cycling of C through the ecosystem. Net primary productivity (NPP) of a closed-canopy Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand was assessed for three years in a free-air CO2-enrichment (FACE) experiment. NPP increased 21\% in stands exposed to elevated CO2, and there was no loss of response over time. Wood increment increased significantly during the first year of exposure, but subsequently most of the extra C was allocated to production of leaves and fine roots. These pools turn over more rapidly than wood, thereby reducing the potential of the forest stand to sequester additional C in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Hence, while this experiment provides the first evidence that CO2 enrichment can increase productivity in a closed-canopy deciduous forest, the implications of this result must be tempered because the increase in productivity resulted in faster cycling of C through the system rather than increased C storage in wood. The fate of the additional C entering the soil system and the environmental interactions that influence allocation need further investigation.},

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) and its seasonal dynamics are key determinants of terrestrial productivity and, therefore, of the response of ecosystems to a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Despite the central importance of LAI, there is very little evidence from which to assess how forest LAI will respond to increasing [CO2]. We assessed LAI and related leaf indices of a closed-canopy deciduous forest for 4~years in 25-m-diameter plots that were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 (542~ppm) in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. LAI of this Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) stand was about 6 and was relatively constant year-to-year, including the 2~years prior to the onset of CO2 treatment. LAI throughout the 1999--2002 growing seasons was assessed through a combination of data on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance, mass of litter collected in traps, and leaf mass per unit area (LMA). There was no effect of [CO2] on any expression of leaf area, including peak LAI, average LAI, or leaf area duration. Canopy mass and LMA, however, were significantly increased by CO2 enrichment. The hypothesized connection between light compensation point (LCP) and LAI was rejected because LCP was reduced by [CO2] enrichment only in leaves under full sun, but not in shaded leaves. Data on PAR interception also permitted calculation of absorbed PAR (APAR) and light use efficiency (LUE), which are key parameters connecting satellite assessments of terrestrial productivity with ecosystem models of future productivity. There was no effect of [CO2] on APAR, and the observed increase in net primary productivity in elevated [CO2] was ascribed to an increase in LUE, which ranged from 1.4 to 2.4~g MJ-1. The current evidence seems convincing that LAI of non-expanding forest stands will not be different in a future CO2-enriched atmosphere and that increases in LUE and productivity in elevated [CO2] are driven primarily by functional responses rather than by structural changes. Ecosystem or regional models that incorporate feedbacks on resource use through LAI should not assume that LAI will increase with CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Fine-root production and turnover are important regulators of the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems and key components of their response to global change. We present a nearly continuous 6-year record of fine-root production and mortality from minirhizotron analysis of a closed-canopy, deciduous sweetgum forest in a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment. Annual production of fine roots was more than doubled in plots with 550 ppm CO2 compared with plots in ambient air. This response was the primary component of the sustained 22\% increase in net primary productivity. Annual fine-root mortality matched annual production, and the mean residence time of roots was not altered by elevated CO2, but peak fine-root standing crop in midsummer was significantly higher in CO2-enriched plots, especially deeper in the soil profile. The preferential allocation of additional carbon to fine roots, which have a fast turnover rate in this species, rather than to stemwood reduces the possibility of long-term enhancement by elevated CO2 of carbon sequestration in biomass. However, sequestration of some of the fine-root carbon in soil pools is not precluded, and there may be other benefits to the tree from a seasonally larger and deeper fine-root system. Root-system dynamics can explain differences among ecosystems in their response to elevated atmospheric CO2; hence, accurate assessments of carbon flux and storage in forests in a globally changing atmosphere must account for this unseen and difficult-to-measure component.},

  abstract = {Stimulation of terrestrial plant production by rising CO2 concentration is projected to reduce the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Coupled climate--carbon cycle models are sensitive to this negative feedback on atmospheric CO2, but model projections are uncertain because of the expectation that feedbacks through the nitrogen (N) cycle will reduce this so-called CO2 fertilization effect. We assessed whether N limitation caused a reduced stimulation of net primary productivity (NPP) by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration over 11 y in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in a deciduous Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand in Tennessee. During the first 6 y of the experiment, NPP was significantly enhanced in forest plots exposed to 550 ppm CO2 compared with NPP in plots in current ambient CO2, and this was a consistent and sustained response. However, the enhancement of NPP under elevated CO2 declined from 24\% in 2001--2003 to 9\% in 2008. Global analyses that assume a sustained CO2 fertilization effect are no longer supported by this FACE experiment. N budget analysis supports the premise that N availability was limiting to tree growth and declining over time ---an expected consequence of stand development, which was exacerbated by elevated CO2. Leaf- and stand-level observations provide mechanistic evidence that declining N availability constrained the tree response to elevated CO2; these observations are consistent with stand-level model projections. This FACE experiment provides strong rationale and process understanding for incorporating N limitation and N feedback effects in ecosystem and global models used in climate change assessments.},

Leaf litter was decomposed for 12 months under factorial combinations of 360 vs. 560 {$\mu$}L CO2 L-1, crossed with 36 vs. 55 nL O3 L-1. To differentiate between substrate quality and environment effects, litterbags were placed in their Native Plots of origin or transplanted into the other treatments. CO2 enrichment, regardless of O3 concentration, produced poorer quality litter (high C/N, lignin/N and condensed tannins) than did ambient CO2 (low C/N, lignin/N and condensed tannins). Substrate quality differences were reflected in the mass loss rates (k-values), which were high for litter generated under ambient CO2 (0.887 year-1) and low for litter generated under elevated CO2 (0.674 year-1). The rate-retarding effects of CO2 enrichment were neither alleviated nor exacerbated by O3 exposure. Decay rates varied, however, depending on whether litter was placed back into its plot of origin or transplanted to Common Gardens. The results of this study are species specific, but they have important implications for understanding the processes regulating storage of fixed C and the release of CO2 from northern forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {While the significance of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on instantaneous leaf-level processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration is rarely disputed, its integrated effect at ecosystem level and at long-time scales remains a subject of debate. In part, the uncertainty stems from the inherent leaf-to-leaf variability in gas exchange rates. By combining 10 years of leaf gas exchange measurements collected during the Duke Forest Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment and three different leaf-scale stomatal conductance models, the leaf-to-leaf variability in photosynthetic and stomatal conductance properties is examined. How this variability is then reflected in ecosystem water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes is explored by scaling up the leaf-level process to the canopy using model calculations. The main results are: (a) the space-time variability of the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance response is considerable as expected. (b) Variability of the calculated leaf level fluxes is dependent on both the meteorological drivers and differences in leaf age, position within the canopy, nitrogen and CO2 fertilization, which can be accommodated in model parameters. (c) Meteorological variability is playing the dominant role at short temporal scales while parameter variability is significant at longer temporal scales. (d) Leaf level results do not necessarily translate to similar ecosystem level responses due to indirect effects and other compensatory mechanisms related to long-term vegetation dynamics and ecosystem water balance.},

  abstract = {Elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) is expected to reduce the impacts of drought and increase photosynthetic rates via two key mechanisms: first, through decreased stomatal conductance (gs) and increased soil water content (VSWC) and second, through increased leaf internal CO2 (Ci) and decreased stomatal limitations (Slim). It is unclear if such findings from temperate grassland studies similarly pertain to warmer ecosystems with periodic water deficits. We tested these mechanisms in three important C3 herbaceous species in a periodically dry Eucalyptus woodland and investigated how eCO2-induced photosynthetic enhancement varied with seasonal water availability, over a 3 year period. Leaf photosynthesis increased by 10\%--50\% with a 150 {$\mu$}mol mol-1 increase in atmospheric CO2 across seasons. This eCO2-induced increase in photosynthesis was a function of seasonal water availability, given by recent precipitation and mean daily VSWC. The highest photosynthetic enhancement by eCO2 ({$>$}30\%) was observed during the most water-limited period, for example, with VSWC {$<$}0.07 in this sandy surface soil. Under eCO2 there was neither a significant decrease in gs in the three herbaceous species, nor increases in VSWC, indicating no ``water-savings effect'' of eCO2. Periods of low VSWC showed lower gs (less than {$\approx$} 0.12 mol m-2 s-1), higher relative Slim ({$>$}30\%) and decreased Ci under the ambient CO2 concentration (aCO2), with leaf photosynthesis strongly carboxylation-limited. The alleviation of Slim by eCO2 was facilitated by increasing Ci, thus yielding a larger photosynthetic enhancement during dry periods. We demonstrated that water availability, but not eCO2, controls gs and hence the magnitude of photosynthetic enhancement in the understory herbaceous plants. Thus, eCO2 has the potential to alter vegetation functioning in a periodically dry woodland understory through changes in stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, not by the ``water-savings effect'' usually invoked in grasslands.},

  abstract = {The stability of soil organic matter (SOM) pools exposed to elevated CO2 and warming has not been evaluated adequately in long-term experiments and represents a substantial source of uncertainty in predicting ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We conducted a 6-year experiment combining free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE, 550{$\quad$}ppm) and warming (+2{$\quad^\circ$}C) to evaluate changes in SOM accumulation in native Australian grassland. In this system, competitive interactions appear to favor C4 over C3 species under FACE and warming. We therefore investigated the role of plant functional type (FT) on biomass and SOM responses to the long-term treatments by carefully sampling soil under patches of C3- and C4-dominated vegetation. We used physical fractionation to quantify particulate organic matter (POM) and long-term incubation to assess potential decomposition rates. Aboveground production of C4 grasses increased in response to FACE, but total root biomass declined. Across treatments, C{$\quad$}:{$\quad$}N ratios were higher in leaves, roots and POM of C4 vegetation. CO2 and temperature treatments interacted with FT to influence SOM, and especially POM, such that soil carbon was increased by warming under C4 vegetation, but not in combination with elevated CO2. Potential decomposition rates increased in response to FACE and decreased with warming, possibly owing to treatment effects on soil moisture and microbial community composition. Decomposition was also inversely correlated with root N concentration, suggesting increased microbial demand for older, N-rich SOM in treatments with low root N inputs. This research suggests that C3--C4 vegetation responses to future climate conditions will strongly influence SOM storage in temperate grasslands.},

  abstract = {The flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere may ameliorate or exacerbate climate change, depending on the relative responses of ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration to warming temperatures, rising atmospheric CO2, and altered precipitation. The combined effect of these global change factors is especially uncertain because of their potential for interactions and indirectly mediated conditions such as soil moisture. Here, we present observations of CO2 fluxes from a multi-factor experiment in semi-arid grassland that suggests a potentially strong climate -- carbon cycle feedback under combined elevated [CO2] and warming. Elevated [CO2] alone, and in combination with warming, enhanced ecosystem respiration to a greater extent than photosynthesis, resulting in net C loss over four years. The effect of warming was to reduce respiration especially during years of below-average precipitation, by partially offsetting the effect of elevated [CO2] on soil moisture and C cycling. Carbon losses were explained partly by stimulated decomposition of soil organic matter with elevated [CO2]. The climate -- carbon cycle feedback observed in this semiarid grassland was mediated by soil water content, which was reduced by warming and increased by elevated [CO2]. Ecosystem models should incorporate direct and indirect effects of climate change on soil water content in order to accurately predict terrestrial feedbacks and long-term storage of C in soil.},

Length and width of individual roots were measured from minirhizotron video images bimonthly over 4~years starting when the seedlings were 1.5~years old.

Yearly values of fine-root length standing crop (m~m-2), production (m~m-2~year-1), and mortality (m~m-2~year-1) were consistently higher in elevated CO2 treatments throughout the study, except for mortality in the first year; however, the only statistically significant CO2 effects were in the fine-root length standing crop (m~m-2) in the second and third years, and production and mortality (m~m-2~year-1) in the third year. Higher mortality (m~m-2~year-1) in elevated CO2 was due to greater standing crop rather than shorter life span, as fine roots lived longer in elevated CO2. No significant N effects were noted for annual cumulative production, cumulative mortality, or mean standing crop. N availability did not significantly affect responses of fine-root standing crop, production, or mortality to elevated CO2. Multi-year studies at all life stages of trees are important to characterize belowground responses to factors such as atmospheric CO2 and N-fertilization.

  abstract = {The degree to which rising atmospheric CO(2) will be offset by carbon (C) sequestration in forests depends in part on the capacity of trees and soil microbes to make physiological adjustments that can alleviate resource limitation. Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO(2) enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the rhizosphere. Over the course of 3 years, we measured in situ rates of root exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated with elevated CO(2) (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates ({$\mu$}g C cm(-1) root h(-1) ) by 55\% during the primary growing season, leading to a 50\% annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R(2) = 0.66; P = 0.006) in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO(2) and N fertilization did not increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO(2) in low fertility soils are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in forest ecosystems.},

There are no walls interfering with incident radiation and no artificial constraints on rooting depth. With current FACE technology, CO2 enriched air is injected around the perimeter of circular plots and natural wind disperses the CO2 across the experimental area. Under stable, nighttime wind conditions found in FACE wheat experiments at Maricopa, Arizona, the blowers used to inject CO2 exerted subtle effects on the microclimate in a manner analogous to wind machines used for orchard frost protection. Plots equipped with blowers had nighttime foliage and air temperatures that averaged 0.6--1.0{$^\circ$}C warmer than controls without blowers. A secondary effect of these elevated temperatures was that plots equipped with blowers displayed differences in dew duration (time that leaves were wet was reduced 30\%), plant development (anthesis occurred 4 days earlier), and senescence [as measured with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)]. Natural wind and turbulence appear to overcome the blower effect during daytime treatments and on some nights. Aerial thermal imagery (8--12{$\mu$}m) acquired during the 1998 FACE experiment with grain sorghum provided additional evidence of the blower effect on canopy temperatures. Since increased plant tissue temperatures also occur when elevated CO2 induces partial stomatal closure and reduces transpiration, not all instances of canopy temperature elevation in CO2 enriched plots can be ascribed solely to the presence of blowers. It is concluded that proper controls for FACE facilities should have similar air flows to those used in the FACE plots. Advantages and disadvantages to nighttime CO2 enrichment are discussed.},

In turn, senescence of fine roots can be the greatest source of C input to forest soils. Consequently, important questions in ecology entail the extent to which increasing atmospheric CO2 may alter the allocation of carbon to, and demography of, fine roots. Using microvideo and image analysis technology, we demonstrate that elevated atmospheric CO2 increases the rates of both fine root production and mortality. Rates of root mortality also increased substantially as soil nitrogen availability increased, regardless of CO2 concentration. Nitrogen greatly influenced the proportional allocation of carbon to leaves vs. fine roots. The amount of available nitrogen in the soil appears to be the most important factor regulating fine root demography in Populus trees.},

  abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to understand how atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil-nitrogen (N) availability influence Populus tremuloides fine-root growth and morphology. Soil-N availability may limit the growth response of forests to elevated CO2 and interact with atmospheric CO2 to alter litter quality and ecosystem carbon (C) and N cycling. We established a CO2 {\texttimes} N factorial field experiment and grew six genotypes of P. tremuloides for 2.5 growing seasons in 20 large open-top chamber/root-box experimental units at the University of Michigan Biological Station in northern lower Michigan (USA). In this paper we describe an integrated examination of how atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability influence fine-root morphology, growth, mortality, and biomass. We also studied the relationship between root biomass and total soil respiration. Over 80\% of the absorbing root length of P. tremuloides was accounted for by roots {$<$}0.4 mm in diameter, and specific root length (100--250 m/g) was much greater than reports for other temperate and boreal deciduous trees. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the diameter and length of individual roots. In contrast, soil N had no effect on root morphology. Fine-root length production and mortality, measured with minirhizotrons, was controlled by the interaction between atmospheric CO2 and soil N. Rates of root production and mortality were significantly greater at elevated CO2 when trees grew in high-N soil, but there were no CO2 effects at low soil N. Fine-root biomass increased 137--194\% in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2 increased fine-root biomass (52\%) in high soil N, but differences in low soil N were not significant. Across all treatments, dynamic estimates of net fine-root production were highly correlated with fine-root biomass (soil cores; r = 0.975). Mean rates of soil respiration were more than double in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2, when compared to ambient atmospheric CO2, increased mean rates of soil respiration 19\% in 1995 and 25\% in 1996. Across all treatments, total root biomass was linearly related to mean rates of soil respiration (r2 = 0.96). Our results indicate that atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability strongly interact to influence P. tremuloides fine-root morphology, growth, and C turnover. Aspen-dominated ecosystems of the future are likely to have greater productivity fueled by greater nutrient uptake due to greater root length production. Further, it appears that elevated atmospheric CO2 will result in greater C inputs to soil through greater rates of fine-root production and turnover, especially in high-fertility soils. Increased C inputs to soil result in greater rates of soil respiration. At this time, it is not clear what effects increased rates of root turnover will have on C storage in the soil.},

The objectives of this study were: to understand how soil respiration responded to the experimental treatments; to determine whether fine-root biomass was correlated to rates of soil respiration; and to measure rates of fine-root turnover in aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests and determine whether root turnover might be driving patterns in soil respiration. Soil respiration was measured, root biomass was determined, and estimates of root production, mortality and biomass turnover were made. Soil respiration was greatest in the +CO(2) and +CO(2) +O(3) treatments across all three plant communities. Soil respiration was correlated with increases in fine-root biomass. In the aspen community, annual fine-root production and mortality (g m(-2)) were positively affected by +O(3). After 10 yr of exposure, +CO(2) +O(3)-induced increases in belowground carbon allocation suggest that the positive effects of elevated CO(2) on belowground net primary productivity (NPP) may not be offset by negative effects of O(3). For the aspen community, fine-root biomass is actually stimulated by +O(3), and especially +CO(2) +O(3).},

We characterized the influence of free-air-CO               2               -enrichment (ambient +200{$\quad$}ppm) on fine roots for a period of 6 years (Autumn 1998 through Autumn 2004) in an 18-year-old loblolly pine (               Pinus taeda               ) plantation near Durham, NC, USA using minirhizotrons. Root production and mortality were synchronous processes that peaked most years during spring and early summer. Seasonality of fine root production and mortality was not influenced by atmospheric CO               2               availability. Averaged over all 6 years of the study, CO               2               enrichment increased average fine root standing crop (+23\%), annual root length production (+25\%), and annual root length mortality (+36\%). Larger increase in mortality compared with production with CO               2               enrichment is explained by shorter average fine root lifespans in elevated plots (500 days) compared with controls (574 days). The effects of CO               2               -enrichment on fine root proliferation tended to shift from shallow (0--15{$\quad$}cm) to deeper soil depths (15--30) with increasing duration of the study. Diameters of fine roots were initially increased by CO               2               -enrichment but this effect diminished over time. Averaged over 6 years, annual fine root NPP was estimated to be 163{$\quad$}g{$\quad$}dw{$\quad$}m               -2               {$\quad$}yr               -1               in CO               2               -enriched plots and 130{$\quad$}g{$\quad$}dw{$\quad$}m               -2               {$\quad$}yr               -1               in control plots (               P               = 0.13) corresponding to an average annual additional input of fine root biomass to soil of 33{$\quad$}g{$\quad$}m               -2               {$\quad$}yr               -1               in CO               2               -enriched plots. A lack of consistent CO               2               {\texttimes} year effects suggest that the positive effects of CO               2               enrichment on fine root growth persisted 6 years following minirhizotron tube installation (8 years following initiation of the CO               2               fumigation). Although CO               2               -enrichment contributed to extra flow of C into soil in this experiment, the magnitude of the effect was small suggesting only modest potential for fine root processes to directly contribute to soil C storage in south-eastern pine forests.},

Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns, including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively, which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes. Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA, that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1, 4, 9 or 16 species), soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m2 per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment (ambient, 368 micromol mol-1, versus elevated, 560 micromol mol-1). We found that the enhanced biomass accumulation in response to elevated levels of CO2 or nitrogen, or their combination, is less in species-poor than in species-rich assemblages.},

We found that elevated CO{$_2$} led to a 58\% increase in biomass at the end of the experiment. However, estimation of stem mass during the growing season showed that elevated CO{$_2$} did not affect relative growth rate during the fourth growing season, and therefore, that the large accumulation of biomass was the result of an early effect on relative growth rate in previous years. Trees grown in elevated CO{$_2$} invested more carbon into fine roots and had relatively less leaf area than trees grown in ambient CO{$_2$}. In contrast with previous studies, acceleration of growth did not involve a significant decline in nutrient concentrations of any plant tissue. It is likely that increased fine root density assisted the trees in meeting their nutrient demands. Changes in the species composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the trees grown in elevated CO{$_2$} in favour of late successional species supports the hypothesis of an acceleration of the ontogeny of the trees in elevated CO{$_2$}.},

Seven-year-old trees of Clones 4 and 80 growing outside in open-top chambers were exposed for 3 years to the following treatments: outside control (OC); chamber control (CC); 2 x ambient [CO2] (EC); 2 x ambient [O3] (EO); and 2 x ambient [CO2] + 2 x ambient [O3] (EC+EO). When the results for the two clones were analyzed together, elevated [CO2] increased tree growth and biomass, but had no effect on biomass allocation. Total leaf area increased and leaf abscission was delayed in response to elevated [CO2]. Elevated [O3] decreased dry mass of roots and branches and mean leaf size and induced earlier leaf abscission in the autumn; otherwise, the effects of elevated [O3] were small across the clones. However, there were significant interactions between elevated [CO2] and elevated [O3]. When results for the clones were analyzed separately, stem diameter, volume growth and total biomass of Clone 80 were increased by elevated [CO2] and the stimulatory effects of elevated [CO2] on stem volume growth and total leaf area increased during the 3-year study. Clone 80 was unaffected by elevated [O3]. In Clone 4, elevated [O3] decreased root and branch biomass by 38 and 29\%, respectively, whereas this clone showed few responses to elevated [CO2]. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased total leaf area in Clone 80 only, which may partly explain the smaller growth responses to elevated [CO2] of Clone 4 compared with Clone 80. Although we observed responses to elevated [O3], the responses to the EC+EO and EC treatments were similar, indicating that the trees only responded to elevated [O3] under ambient [CO2] conditions, perhaps reflecting a greater quantity of carbohydrates available for detoxification and repair in elevated [CO2].},

The trees were measured for gas exchange, leaf size, date of leaf abscission, size and biochemical characteristics of the overwintering buds and early leaf development during the 8th--9th year of free-air CO2 and O3 exposure at the Aspen FACE site located near Rhinelander, WI. Net photosynthesis was enhanced 49--73\% by elevated [CO2], and decreased 13--30\% by elevated [O3]. Elevated [CO2] delayed, and elevated [O3] tended to accelerate, leaf abscission in autumn. Elevated [CO2] increased the ratio of monosaccharides to di- and oligosaccharides in aspen buds, which may indicate a lag in cold acclimation. The total carbon concentration in overwintering buds was unaffected by the treatments, although elevated [O3] decreased the amount of starch by 16\% in birch buds, and reduced the size of aspen buds, which may be related to the delayed leaf development in aspen during the spring. Elevated [CO2] generally ameliorated the effects of elevated [O3]. Our results show that both elevated [CO2] and elevated [O3] have the potential to alter carbon metabolism of overwintering buds. These changes may cause carry-over effects during the next growing season.},

AM fungal hyphal lengths were greater in the sandstone, but were unaffected in the serpentine community. This lent support to the hypothesis that there may be a tradeoff in resource allocation to more fine roots or greater mycorrhizal extraradical hyphal length.

We hypothesized that legumes would be able to avoid N limitation at elevated [CO               2               ]. Soybean was grown without N fertilizer from germination to final senescence at elevated [CO               2               ] over two growing seasons under fully open-air conditions, providing a model legume system. Measurements of photosynthesis and foliar carbohydrate content showed that plants growing at elevated [CO               2               ] had a               c               . 25\% increase in the daily integral of photosynthesis and               c               . 58\% increase in foliar carbohydrate content, suggesting that plants at elevated [CO               2               ] had a surplus of photosynthate. Soybeans had a low leaf N content at the beginning of the season, which was a further               c               . 17\% lower at elevated [CO               2               ]. In the middle of the season, ureide, total amino acid and N content increased markedly, and the effect of elevated [CO               2               ] on leaf N content disappeared. Analysis of individual amino acid levels supported the conclusion that plants at elevated [CO               2               ] overcame an early-season N limitation. These soybean plants showed a               c               . 16\% increase in dry mass at final harvest and showed no significant effect of elevated [CO               2               ] on leaf N, protein or total amino acid content in the latter part of the season. One possible explanation for these findings is that N fixation had increased, and that these plants had acclimated to the increased N demand at elevated [CO               2               ].},

  abstract = {Background Biochemical models predict that photosynthesis in C3 plants is most frequently limited by the slower of two processes, the maximum capacity of the enzyme Rubisco to carboxylate RuBP (Vc,max), or the regeneration of RuBP via electron transport (J). At current atmospheric [CO2] levels Rubisco is not saturated; consequently, elevating [CO2] increases the velocity of carboxylation and inhibits the competing oxygenation reaction which is also catalyzed by Rubisco. In the future, leaf photosynthesis (A) should be increasingly limited by RuBP regeneration, as [CO2] is predicted to exceed 550 ppm by 2050. The C3 cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7 bisphosphatase (SBPase, EC 3.1.3.17) has been shown to exert strong metabolic control over RuBP regeneration at light saturation. Results We tested the hypothesis that tobacco transformed to overexpressing SBPase will exhibit greater stimulation of A than wild type (WT) tobacco when grown under field conditions at elevated [CO2] (585 ppm) under fully open air fumigation. Growth under elevated [CO2] stimulated instantaneous A and the diurnal photosynthetic integral (A') more in transformants than WT. There was evidence of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated [CO2] via downregulation of Vc,max in both WT and transformants. Nevertheless, greater carbon assimilation and electron transport rates (J and Jmax) for transformants led to greater yield increases than WT at elevated [CO2] compared to ambient grown plants. Conclusion These results provide proof of concept that increasing content and activity of a single photosynthesis enzyme can enhance carbon assimilation and yield of C3 crops grown at [CO2] expected by the middle of the 21st century.},

However, microbial N, CO2-C production (0--14 days) in field-moist soil, and net mineral-N production (14--56 days) in soil at 60\% of water-holding capacity were significantly higher (per unit weight of soil) in the elevated-[CO2] treatment (P=0.071, 0.063, 0.003, respectively); the degree of these treatment differences was roughly similar when values were also expressed on a total C or N basis. Relationships with soil moisture were mainly non-significant for microbial C and N, but mainly significant (PP2-C production. Overall, the data tend to suggest greater soil metabolic activity, but little if any change in soil C pools, after 5 years' exposure of the pasture to elevated [CO2]. They do, however, suggest increased availability of N, probably because of increased inputs from N-fixing clovers.},

We have previously reported results for the first 5 years where, at this relatively low level of CO2 enrichment, most soil properties changed gradually and non-significantly. Here we add data from a further 5 years of enrichment and find that most soil properties had changed significantly. Soil moisture was greater under elevated CO2 but we could find no evidence that this was the cause of changes in other properties, suggesting that increased inputs of C and N in the high CO2 regime were driving soil differences. When soil total C and N were adjusted to account for differences in starting concentrations there was evidence of increased pool sizes and increased C/N under elevated CO2. Microbial C and N pools also increased with CO2 as did heterotrophic respiration and labile C and N fractions. There were few changes in N mineralization but no evidence for reduced rates under elevated CO2. There was little evidence for a direct effect of changes in soil properties on plant biomass responses to CO2 but the changes we observed relate to pools and fluxes that are known to be important in both production and environmental outcomes in grassland systems.},

Although maize is the most highly produced crop worldwide, few studies have evaluated the interactive effects of elevated [               CO               2               ] and temperature on its photosynthetic physiology, agronomic traits or biomass, and seed yield under open field conditions. This study investigates the effects of rising [               CO               2               ] and warmer temperature, independently and in combination, on maize grown in the field throughout a full growing season. Free-air               CO               2               enrichment (               FACE               ) technology was used to target atmospheric [               CO               2               ] to 200~               {$\mu$}               mol~mol               -1               above ambient [               CO               2               ] and infrared heaters to target a plant canopy increase of 3.5~{$^\circ$}C, with actual season mean heating of {\textasciitilde}2.7~{$^\circ$}C, mimicking conditions predicted by the second half of this century. Photosynthetic gas-exchange parameters, leaf nitrogen and carbon content, leaf water potential components, and developmental measurements were collected throughout the season, and biomass and yield were measured at the end of the growing season. As predicted for a C               4               plant, elevated [               CO               2               ] did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass, or yield. Canopy warming caused a large shift in aboveground allocation by stimulating season-long vegetative biomass and decreasing reproductive biomass accumulation at both               CO               2               concentrations, resulting in decreased harvest index. Warming caused a reduction in photosynthesis due to down-regulation of photosynthetic biochemical parameters and the decrease in the electron transport rate. The reduction in seed yield with warming was driven by reduced photosynthetic capacity and by a shift in aboveground carbon allocation away from reproduction. This field study portends that future warming will reduce yield in maize, and this will not be mitigated by higher atmospheric [               CO               2               ] unless appropriate adaptation traits can be introduced into future cultivars.},

We found that aboveground net primary productivity for the five dominant plant species in the understory community, C:N ratios of leaf tissue for four of the five dominant understory taxa, amounts of herbivory, and arthropod abundance and richness across all trophic groups did not differ between ambient and elevated CO2 plots. Abundance and richness of particular trophic groups were higher in ambient than in elevated CO2 plots. There were also strong temporal effects on community composition, but no distinct treatment effects.

To investigate the effect on rice (Oryza sativa L.), plants were grown under ambient CO2 (AMB) or free-air CO2-enrichment (FACE) at CO2 concentrations ranged from 275 to 365{$\mu$}molmol-1 above AMB. We supplied 13CO2 to the plants at different growth stages so we could examine the contribution of carbohydrate stored during the vegetative stage or newly fixed carbohydrate produced during the grain-filling stage to ear weight at grain maturity. In plants supplied with 13C at the panicle-initiation or pre-heading stages, plants grown under FACE had more starch in the stems at heading, but there was no difference in stem 13C content. Furthermore, there were no differences between treatments in whole-plant 13C contents at heading and grain maturity. In contrast, plants supplied with 13C at the grain-filling stage had more 13C in the whole plant and the ears at grain maturity under FACE than under AMB, indicating that the increased amount of photosynthate produced at the grain-filling stage under CO2 enrichment might be effectively stored in the grains. Furthermore, regardless of when the 13C was supplied, plants had more 13C in starch in the ears at grain maturity under FACE than under AMB. Therefore, CO2 enrichment appears to promote partitioning of photosynthate produced during both vegetative and grain-filling stages to the grains.},

We estimated canopy CO2 uptake (AnC) at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) study. Rates of AnC estimated from the 4C-A model agreed well with leaf gas exchange measurements (Anet) in both CO2 treatments. Under ambient conditions, monthly sums of net CO2 uptake by the canopy (AnC) were 13\% higher than estimates based on eddy-covariance and chamber measurements. Annual estimates of AnC were only 3\% higher than carbon (C) accumulations and losses estimated from ground-based measurements for the entire stand. The C budget for the Pinus taeda component was well constrained (within 1\% of ground-based measurements). Although the closure of the C budget for the broadleaf species was poorer (within 20\%), these species are a minor component of the forest. Under elevated CO2, the C used annually for growth, turnover, and respiration balanced only 80\% of the AnC. Of the extra 700 g C m-2 a-1 (1999 and 2000 average), 86\% is attributable to surface soil CO2 efflux. This suggests that the production and turnover of fine roots was underestimated or that mycorrhizae and rhizodeposition became an increasingly important component of the C balance. Under elevated CO2, net ecosystem production increased by 272 g C m-2 a-1: 44\% greater than under ambient CO2. The majority (87\%) of this C was sequestered in a moderately long-term C pool in wood, with the remainder in the forest floor--soil subsystem.},

  abstract = {Alpine plant species have been shown to exhibit a more pronounced increase in leaf photosynthesis under elevated CO2 than lowland plants. In order to test whether this higher carbon fixation efficiency will translate into increased biomass production under CO2 enrichment we exposed plots of narrow alpine grassland (Swiss Central Alps, 2470 m) to ambient (355 {$\mu$}l l-1) and elevated (680 {$\mu$}l l-1) CO2 concentration using open top chambers. Part of the plost received moderate mineral nutrient additions (40 kg ha-1 year-1 of nitrogen in a complete fertilizer mix). Under natural nutrient supply CO2 enrichment had no effect on biomass production per unit land area during any of the three seasons studied so far. Correspondingly, the dominant species Carex curvula and Leontodon helveticus as well as Trifolium alpinum did not show a growth response either at the population level or at the shoot level. However, the subdominant generalistic species Poa alpina strongly increased shoot growth (+47\%). Annual root production (in ingrowth cores) was significantly enhanced in C. curvula in the 2nd and 3rd year of investigation (+43\%) but was not altered in the bulk samples for all species. Fertilizer addition generally stimulated above-ground (+48\%) and below-ground (+26\%) biomass production right from the beginning. Annual variations in weather conditions during summer also strongly influenced above-ground biomass production (19--27\% more biomass in warm seasons compared to cool seasons). However, neither nutrient availability nor climate had a significant effect on the CO2 response of the plants. Our results do not support the hypothesis that alpine plants, due to their higher carbon uptake efficiency, will increase biomass production under future atmospheric CO2 enrichment, at least not in such late successional communities. However, as indicated by the response of P. alpina, species-specific responses occur which may lead to altered community structure and perhaps ecosystem functioning in the long-term. Our findings further suggest that possible climatic changes are likely to have a greater impact on plant growth in alpine environments than the direct stimulation of photosynthesis by CO2. Counter-intuitively, our results suggest that even under moderate climate warming or enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition positive biomass responses to CO2 enrichment of the currently dominating species are unlikely.},

The storage of carbon in soils is determined by the fraction that is sequestered in persistent organic materials, such as humus. In experimental forest plots of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) exposed to high CO2 concentrations3,4, nearly half of the carbon uptake is allocated to short-lived tissues, largely foliage. These tissues fall to the ground and decompose, normally contributing only a small portion of their carbon content to refractory soil humic materials5. Such findings call into question the role of soils as long-term carbon sinks, and show the need for a better understanding of carbon cycling in forest soils. Here we report a significant accumulation of carbon in the litter layer of experimental forest plots after three years of growth at increased CO2 concentrations (565\,{\textmu}l\,l-1). But fast turnover times of organic carbon in the litter layer (of about three years) appear to constrain the potential size of this carbon sink. Given the observation that carbon accumulation in the deeper mineral soil layers was absent, we suggest that significant, long-term net carbon sequestration in forest soils is unlikely.},

(perennial ryegrass) at two levels of N fertilization (14 and 56 g m-2 a-1) from 1993 to 2002. The objectives were to determine how plant growth responded to the availability of C and N in the long term and how the supply of N to the plant from the two sources of N in the soil, soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral fertilizer, varied over time. In three field experiments, 15N-labelled fertilizer was used to distinguish the sources of available N. In 1993, harvestable biomass under elevated pCO2 was 7\% higher than under ambient pCO2. This relative pCO2 response increased to 32\% in 2002 at high N, but remained low at low N. Between 1993 and 2002, the proportions and amounts of N in harvestable biomass derived from SOM (excluding remobilized fertilizer) were, at high N, increasingly higher at elevated pCO2 than at ambient pCO2. Two factorial experiments confirmed that at high N, but not at low N, a higher proportion of N in harvestable biomass was derived from soil (including remobilized fertilizer) following 7 and 9 years of elevated pCO2, when compared with ambient pCO2. It is suggested that N availability in the soil initially limited the pCO2 response of harvestable biomass. At high N, the limitation of plant growth decreased over time as a result of the stimulated mobilization of N from soil, especially from SOM. Consequently, harvestable biomass increasingly responded to elevated pCO2. The underlying mechanisms which contributed to the increased mobilization of N from SOM under elevated pCO2 are discussed. This study demonstrated that there are feedback mechanisms in the soil which are only revealed during long-term field experiments. Such investigations are thus, a prerequisite for understanding the responses of ecosystems to elevated pCO2 and N supply.},

  abstract = {Leaf N concentration is important because it is associated with the CO2 assimilatory capacity of crops, and in grasslands, it is an important determinant of forage nutritive value. Consequently, the productivity of both domestic and native animals in future global environments may be closely linked to possible changes in leaf N concentration of grasses. Since grasslands are frequently subjected to water-deficit or N-deficit conditions, it is important to investigate the interactive responses between elevated [CO2] and these stress conditions. Therefore, this 4-year research program was undertaken with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a model system for forage grasses, to document the potential changes in leaf N concentration in response to global environment changes. Wheat crops grown under field conditions near Phoenix, AZ, USA, were subjected to elevated [CO2] and either water-deficit or N-deficit treatments using large Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) arrays. Surprisingly, the elevated [CO2] treatment under optimum conditions resulted in little change in leaf N concentration. Therefore, no change in the nutritive value of forage from highly managed pastures would be expected. Further, water-deficit treatment had little influence on leaf N concentration. To some extent, the lack of response to the water-deficit treatment resulted because severe deficits did not develop until late in the growing seasons. Only on one date late in the season was the water-deficit treatment found to result in decreased leaf N concentration. The low N treatment in combination with elevated [CO2], however, had a large influence on leaf N concentration. Low levels of applied N resulted in decreased leaf N concentration under both [CO2] treatments, but the lowest levels of leaf N concentration were obtained under elevated [CO2] through much of the growing season. These results point to a potential problem with grasslands in that the nutritive value of the forage consumed by animals will be decreased under future global environment changes.},

Here we show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem, that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50\% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year. However, elevated CO2 does not enhance production in a drought year. We also found that above-ground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increases more at elevated CO2 than in several species of native annuals. Consequently, elevated CO2 might enhance the long-term success and dominance of exotic annual grasses in the region. This shift in species composition in favour of exotic annual grasses, driven by global change, has the potential to accelerate the fire cycle, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the deserts of western North America.},

The dominant forb and grass species exhibited accelerated phenology, increased size, and higher reproduction at elevated (CO2 ) in a wet El Ni{\~n}o year near the beginning of the experiment. However, a multiyear dry cycle resulted in no increases in productivity or reproductive allocation for the remainder of the experiment. At the community level, early indications of increased dominance of the invasive Bromus rubens at elevated (CO2 ) gave way to an absence of Bromus in the community during a drought cycle, with a resurgence late in the experiment in response to higher rainfall and a corresponding high density of Bromus in a final soil seed bank analysis, particularly at elevated (CO2 ). This long-term experiment resulted in two primary conclusions: (i) elevated (CO2 ) does not increase productivity of annuals in most years; and (ii) relative stimulation of invasive grasses will likely depend on future precipitation, with a wetter climate favoring invasive grasses but currently predicted greater aridity favoring native dicots.},

However, great uncertainties exist for the CO2 fertilisation effects, particularly when its interactions with other global change factors are considered. A four-factor (CO2, temperature, precipitation and nitrogen) experiment revealed that elevated CO2 did not affect either gross ecosystem productivity or ecosystem respiration, and consequently resulted in no changes of net ecosystem productivity in a semi-arid grassland despite whether temperature, precipitation and nitrogen were elevated or not. The observations could be primarily attributable to the offset of ecosystem carbon uptake by enhanced soil carbon release under CO2 enrichment. Our findings indicate that arid and semi-arid ecosystems may not be sensitive to CO2 enrichment as previously expected and highlight the urgent need to incorporate this mechanism into most IPCC carbon-cycle models for convincing projection of terrestrial carbon sink and its feedback to climate change.},

  abstract = {Rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]) may influence forest successional development and species composition of understory plant communities by altering biomass production of plant species of functional groups. Here, we describe how elevated [CO2] (eCO2) affects aboveground biomass within the understory community of a temperate deciduous forest at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facility in eastern Tennessee, USA. We asked if (i) CO2 enrichment affected total understory biomass and (ii) whether total biomass responses could be explained by changes in understory species composition or changes in relative abundance of functional groups through time.The FACE experiment started in 1998 with three rings receiving ambient [CO2] (aCO2) and two rings receiving eCO2. From 2001 to 2003, we estimated species-specific, woody versus herbaceous and total aboveground biomass by harvesting four 1 {\texttimes} 0.5-m subplots within the established understory plant community in each FACE plot. In 2008, we estimated herbaceous biomass as previously but used allometric relationships to estimate woody biomass across two 5 {\texttimes} 5-m quadrats in each FACE plot.Across years, aboveground biomass of the understory community was on average 25\% greater in eCO2 than in aCO2 plots. We could not detect differences in plant species composition between aCO2 and eCO2 treatments. However, we did observe shifts in the relative abundance of plant functional groups, which reflect important structural changes in the understory community. In 2001--03, little of the understory biomass was in woody species; herbaceous species made up 94\% of the total understory biomass across [CO2] treatments. Through time, woody species increased in importance, mostly in eCO2, and in 2008, the contribution of herbaceous species to total understory biomass was 61\% in aCO2 and only 33\% in eCO2 treatments. Our results suggest that rising atmospheric [CO2] could accelerate successional development and have longer term impact on forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. To elucidate how atmospheric CO2 enrichment, enhanced nutrient supply and soil quality interact to affect regrowth of temperate forests, young Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies trees were grown together in large model ecosystems. Identical communities were established on a nutrient-poor acidic and on a more fertile calcareous soil and tree growth, leaf area index, fine root density and soil respiration monitored over four complete growing seasons. Biomass responses to CO2 enrichment and enhanced N supply at the end of the experiment reflected compound interest effects of growth stimulation during the first two to three seasons rather than persistent stimulation over the whole duration of the experiment. Whereas biomass of Picea was enhanced in elevated CO2 on both soils, Fagus responded negatively to CO2 on acidic but positively on calcareous soil. Biomass of both species profited from enhanced N supply on the poor acidic soil only. Leaf area index on both soils was greater in high N supply as a consequence of a stimulation early in the experiment, but was unaffected by CO2 enrichment. Fine root density on acidic soil was increased in high N supply, but this did not stimulate soil respiration rate. In contrast, elevated CO2 stimulated both fine root density and soil CO2 efflux on calcareous soil, especially towards the end of the experiment. Our experiment suggests that future species dominance in beech-spruce forests is likely to change in response to CO2 enrichment, but this response is subject to complex interactions with environmental factors other than CO2, particularly soil type.},

Disease incidence was lower in plots with either elevated [CO(2)] or enriched N (-57 and -37\%, respectively) than in plots with ambient conditions. Elevated [CO(2)] had no significant effect on total plant biomass, or on photosynthetic rate, but reduced tissue\%N by 13\%. In contrast, N fertilization increased both biomass and total plant N by 70\%, and as a consequence tissue\%N was unaffected and photosynthetic rate was lower on N fertilized plants than on unfertilized plants. Regardless of treatment, photosynthetic rate was reduced on leaves with disease symptoms. On average across all treatments, asymptomatic leaf tissue on diseased leaves had 53\% lower photosynthetic rate than non-diseased leaves, indicating that the negative effect from the disease extended beyond the visual lesion area. Our results show that, in this instance, indirect effects from elevated [CO(2)], i.e., lower disease incidence, had a stronger effect on realized photosynthetic rate than the direct effect of higher [CO(2)].},

Elevated CO               2               significantly decreased leaf N on a mass, but not on an area, basis. N per unit leaf area was related linearly to PPFD               day,sat               throughout the canopies, and elevated CO               2               did not affect that relationship.

The lack of CO               2               stimulation at the mid- and lower canopy was probably related to significant down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity; there was no down-regulation of               Ps               in the upper canopy.

Recent reports suggest that a strong correlation exists between warming and advances in spring phenology but that a weaker correlation is evident between warming and autumnal events implying that other factors may be influencing the timing of autumnal phenology. Using freely rooted, field-grown Populus in two Free Air CO2 Enrichment Experiments (AspenFACE and PopFACE), we present evidence from two continents and over 2 years that increasing atmospheric CO2 acts directly to delay autumnal leaf coloration and leaf fall. In an atmosphere enriched in CO2 (by approximately 45\% of the current atmospheric concentration to 550 ppm) the end of season decline in canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - a commonly used global index for vegetation greenness - was significantly delayed, indicating a greener autumnal canopy, relative to that in ambient CO2. This was supported by a significant delay in the decline of autumnal canopy leaf area index in elevated as compared with ambient CO2, and a significantly smaller decline in end of season leaf chlorophyll content. Leaf level photosynthetic activity and carbon uptake in elevated CO2 during the senescence period was also enhanced compared with ambient CO2. The findings reveal a direct effect of rising atmospheric CO2, independent of temperature in delaying autumnal senescence for Populus, an important deciduous forest tree with implications for forest productivity and adaptation to a future high CO2 world.},

Mycorrhizal root tip biomass responded positively to CO2 fumigation in unfertilized plots, but was unaffected by CO2 under N fertilization. Changes in fine root [N] and [C] call for further study of the effects of N fertilization on fine root function. Here, we show that the stimulation of pine roots by elevated CO2 persisted after 14 years of fumigation, and that trees did not rely exclusively on increased mycorrhizal associations to acquire greater amounts of required N in CO2-enriched plots. Stimulation of root systems by CO2 enrichment was seen primarily for fine root length rather than biomass. This observation indicates that studies measuring only biomass might overlook shifts in root systems that better reflect treatment effects on the potential for soil resource uptake. These results suggest an increase in fine root exploration as a primary means for acquiring additional soil resources under elevated CO2.},

  abstract = {Underlying physiological mechanisms of intraspecific variation in growth response to elevated CO2 concentration [CO2] were investigated using two spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars: Yitpi and H45. Leaf blade elongation rate (LER), leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N) in the expanding leaf blade (ELB, sink) and photosynthesis (A) and C and N status in the last fully expanded leaf blade (LFELB, source) were measured. Plants were grown at ambient [CO2] ({$\sim$}384molmol-1) and elevated [CO2] ({$\sim$}550molmol-1) in the Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment facility. Elevated [CO2] increased leaf area and total dry mass production, respectively, by 42 and 53\% for Yitpi compared with 2 and 13\% for H45. Elevated [CO2] also stimulated the LER by 36\% for Yitpi compared with 5\% for H45. Yitpi showed a 99\% increase in A at elevated [CO2] but no A stimulation was found for H45. There was a strong correlation (r2{$\leq$}0.807) between LER of the ELB and soluble carbohydrate concentration in LFELB. In ELB, the highest spatial N concentration was observed in the cell division zone, where N concentrations were 67.3 and 60.6mg g-1 for Yitpi compared with 51.1 and 39.2mg g-1 for H45 at ambient and elevated [CO2]. In contrast, C concentration increased only in the cell division and cell expansion zone of the ELB of Yitpi. These findings suggest that C supply from the source (LFELB) is cultivar dependent and well correlated with LER, leaf area expansion and whole-plant growth response to elevated [CO2].},

Here we report results obtained at a Japanese rice free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) site under water and soil temperature elevation during two growing seasons. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of high [CO2] (ambient+200 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) and elevated soil temperature (+2 {$^\circ$}C) on CH4 emissions under completely open-field conditions. We found about 80\% enhancement in total seasonal emissions by the additive effects of FACE and warming, indicating a strong positive feedback effect of global warming. The enhancement in CH4 emission (+26\%, P = 0.19) from the effect of FACE alone was similar to that in rice biomass, suggesting that higher photosynthesis led to greater rhizodeposition, providing substrates for methanogenesis.

  abstract = {Quantification of rhizodeposition (root exudates and root turnover) represents a major challenge for understanding the links between above-ground assimilation and below-ground anoxic decomposition of organic carbon in rice paddy ecosystems. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) fumigating depleted 13CO2 in rice paddy resulted in a smaller 13C/12C ratio in plant-assimilated carbon, providing a unique measure by which we partitioned the sources of decomposed gases (CO2 and CH4) into current-season photosynthates (new C) and soil organic matter (old C). In addition, we imposed a soil-warming treatment nested within the CO2 treatments to assess whether the carbon source was sensitive to warming. Compared with the ambient CO2 treatment, the FACE treatment decreased the 13C/12C ratio not only in the rice-plant carbon but also in the soil CO2 and CH4. The estimated new C contribution to dissolved CO2 was minor (ca. 20\%) at the tillering stage, increased with rice growth and was about 50\% from the panicle-formation stage onwards. For CH4, the contribution of new C was greater than for heterotrophic CO2 production; ca. 40--60\% of season-total CH4 production originated from new C with a tendency toward even larger new C contribution with soil warming, presumably because enhanced root decay provided substrates for greater CH4 production. The results suggest a fast and close coupling between photosynthesis and anoxic decomposition in soil, and further indicate a positive feedback of global warming by enhanced CH4 emission through greater rhizodeposition.},

In each year, measurements were taken of stomatal density (SD, number mm-2) and stomatal index (SI, the proportion of epidermal cells forming stomata). In year 5, measurements were also taken of leaf stomatal conductance (g s, {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1), photosynthetic CO2 fixation (A, mmol m-2 s-1), instantaneous water-use efficiency (A/E) and the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 (Ci:Ca). Elevated [CO2] caused reductions in SI in the first year, and in SD in the first 2 years, when the canopy was largely open. In following years, when the canopy had closed, elevated [CO2] had no detectable effects on stomatal numbers or index. In contrast, even after 5 years of exposure to elevated [CO2], g s was reduced, A/E was stimulated, and Ci:Ca was reduced relative to ambient [CO2]. These outcomes from the long-term realistic field conditions of this forest FACE experiment suggest that stomatal numbers (SD and SI) had no role in determining the improved instantaneous leaf-level efficiency of water use under elevated [CO2]. We propose that altered cuticular development during canopy closure may partially explain the changing response of stomata to elevated [CO2], although the mechanism for this remains obscure.},

Previous studies attempting to relate soil N cycling to microbial genetic data mainly focused on a few gene families by PCR, protein assays and functional gene arrays, leaving the taxonomic and functional composition of soil microorganisms involved in the whole N cycle less understood. In this study, 24 soil samples were collected from the long-term experimental site, BioCON, in 2009. A shotgun metagenome sequencing approach was employed to survey the microbial gene families involved in soil N cycle in the grassland that had been exposed to elevated CO2 (eCO2) for {$>$}12 years. In addition to evaluating the responses of major N cycling gene families to long-term eCO2, we also aimed to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of these gene families involved in soil N transformations. At the taxonomic level, organic N metabolism and nitrate reduction had the most diverse microbial species involved. The distinct taxonomic composition of different N cycling processes suggested that the complex N cycle in natural ecosystems was a result of multiple processes by many different microorganisms. Belowground microbial communities that mediate N cycling responded to eCO2 in several different ways, including through stimulated abundances of the gene families related with organic decomposition, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and N2 fixation, and suppressed abundances of the gene families in glutamine synthesis and anammox. This study provides a genetic basis of the microorganisms involved in key processes in the N cycle in complex ecosystems, and shows that long-term eCO2 selectively affects N cycling pathways instead of tuning up every process.},

  abstract = {Elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]) and tropospheric ozone ([O3]) have the potential to affect tree physiology and structure and hence forest water use, which has implications for climate feedbacks. We investigated how a 40\% increase above ambient values in [CO2] and [O3], alone and in combination, affect tree water use of pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch forests in the free air CO2-O3 enrichment experiment near Rhinelander, Wisconsin (Aspen FACE). Measurements of sap flux and canopy leaf area index (L) were made during two growing seasons, when steady-state L had been reached after more than 6 years of exposure to elevated [CO2] and [O3]. Maximum stand-level sap flux was not significantly affected by elevated [O3], but was increased by 18\% by elevated [CO2] averaged across years, communities and O(3) regimes. Treatment effects were similar in pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch communities. Increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] was related to positive CO2 treatment effects on tree size and L (+40\%). Tree water use was not reduced by elevated [O3] despite strong negative O3 treatment effects on tree size and L (-22\%). Elevated [O3] predisposed pure aspen stands to drought-induced sap flux reductions, whereas increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] did not result in lower soil water content in the upper soil or decreasing sap flux relative to control values during dry periods. Maintenance of soil water content in the upper soil in the elevated [CO2] treatment was at least partly a function of enhanced soil water-holding capacity, probably a result of increased organic matter content from increased litter inputs. Our findings that larger trees growing in elevated [CO2] used more water and that tree size, but not maximal water use, was negatively affected by elevated [O3] suggest that the long-term cumulative effects on stand structure may be more important than the expected primary stomatal closure responses to elevated [CO2] and [O3] in determining stand-level water use under possible future atmospheric conditions.},

We tested whether effects of intra- and interspecific planting density of the calcareous grassland perennials Bromus erectus and Carex flacca change in response to elevated [CO2] (600 ppm) by using factorial combinations of seven densities (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 tillers per 8 {\texttimes} 8 cm2 cell) of both species in plots with and without CO2 enrichment. Although aboveground biomass of C. flacca was increased by 54\% under elevated [CO2], the combined aboveground biomass of the whole stand was not significantly increased. C. flacca tended to produce more tillers under elevated [CO2] while B. erectus produced less tillers. The positive effect of [CO2] on the number of tillers of C. flacca was strongest at high intraspecific densities. On the other hand, the negative effect of [CO2] on the number of tillers of B. erectus was not present at intermediate intraspecific planting densities. Seed production of C. flacca was more than doubled under elevated [CO2], while seed production of B. erectus was not affected. Moreover, the mass per seed of C. flacca was increased by elevated [CO2] at intermediate interspecific planting densities while the mass per seed of B. erectus was decreased by elevated [CO2] at high interspecific planting densities. Our results show that the responses of C. flacca and B. erectus to elevated [CO2] depend in a complex way on initial planting densities of both species. In other words, competition between these two model species is both [CO2]- and density dependent. On average, however, the effects of [CO2] on the individual species indicate that the composition of calcareous grasslands is likely to change under elevated [CO2] in favor of C. flacca.},

Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) may also influence phytochemistry and thereby alter the performance of insect herbivores such as the aspen leaf beetle Chrysomela crotchi Brown. 2 The present study aimed to relate genetic- and atmospheric-based variation in aspen phytochemistry to C. crotchi performance (larval development time, adult mass, survivorship). The experiment was conducted at the Aspen Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site in northern Wisconsin. Beetles were reared on three aspen genotypes under elevated CO2 and/or O3. Leaves were collected to determine chemical characteristics. 3 The foliage exhibited significant variation in nitrogen, condensed tannins and phenolic glycosides among genotypes. CO2 and O3, however, had little effect on phytochemistry. Nonetheless, elevated CO2 decreased beetle performance on one aspen genotype and had inconsistent effects on beetles reared on two other genotypes. Elevated O3 decreased beetle performance, especially for beetles reared on an O3-sensitive genotype. Regression analyses indicated that phenolic glycosides and nitrogen explain a substantial amount (27--45\%) of the variation in herbivore performance. 4 By contrast to the negative effects that are typically observed with generalist herbivores, aspen leaf beetles appear to benefit from phenolic glycosides, chemical components that are largely genetically-determined in aspen. The results obtained in the present study indicate that host genetic variation and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will be important factors in the performance of specialist herbivores, such as C. crotchi, in future climates.},

To investigate leaf photosynthetic responses, leaf gas exchange characteristics and nitrogen (N) content were measured in two consecutive years in spring under standard conditions on Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium subterraneum L. and on Trifolium repens L. and Paspalum dilatatum Poir. in the second year only. Leaves of the three C3 species growing under FACE conditions had lower (up to 37\% in 1998 and 22\% in 1999) photosynthetic rates than leaves growing under ambient conditions, when measured at the same standard conditions of high light and 360-380 {\textmu}bar CO2. Differences in photosynthetic rates were correlated with leaf N content and stomatal conductance when measured under these conditions. There was no difference in photosynthetic capacities between ambient or FACE grown P. dilatatum, a C4 grass. Photosynthetic N use efficiency (A/N) differed among species. For the C3 species A/N was on average 25\% greater under FACE conditions and L. perenne had the highest (240 {\textmu}mol CO2 mol N -1 s -1 ) and T. repens the lowest A/N (142 {\textmu}mol CO2 mol N -1 s -1 ) under ambient CO2 partial pressure (p(CO2)). A/N of L. perenne was similar to that of P. dilatatum measured under ambient p(CO2) but 21\% greater under FACE conditions. In the second year, leaf stable carbon isotope compositions ({$\delta$} 13 C) were determined for P. dilatatum, L. perenne and T. repens to assess long-term responses of leaf transpiration efficiency. Using the difference in {$\delta$} 13 C between ambient and FACE-grown P. dilatatum as a reference to difference in {$\delta$} 13 C in ambient and FACE air, we concluded that the ratio of leaf intercellular to ambient p(CO2) (Ci/Ca) was similar between FACE and ambient grown L. perenne and T. repens.},

Seedlings were reared from seed in field soil with a total N concentration of approximately 900 {\textmu}g g-1 or in soil amended with sufficient (NH4)2SO4 to increase total N by 100 {\textmu}g g-1 or 200 {\textmu}g g-1. The 525 {\textmu}L L-1 CO2 treatment within the intermediate N treatment was excluded from the study. Following each of three consecutive growing seasons, whole seedlings of each combination of CO2 and N treatment were harvested to permit assessment of shoot and root growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization. In the second and third growing seasons, drought cycles were imposed by withholding irrigation during which predawn and midday xylem water potential and soil water potential were measured. The first harvest revealed that shoot weight and coarse and fine root weights were increased by growth in elevated CO2. Shoot and root volume and weights were increased by CO2 enrichment at the second harvest, but growth stimulation by the 525 {\textmu}L L-1 CO2 concentration exceeded that in 700 {\textmu}L L-1 CO2 during the first two growing seasons. At the third harvest, above- and below-ground growth increases were largely confined to the 700 {\textmu}L L-1 CO2 treatment, an effect accentuated by high soil N but evident in all N treatments. Ectomycorrhizal formation was reduced by elevated CO2 after one growing season, but thereafter was not significantly affected by CO2 and was unaffected by soil N throughout the study. Results of the xylem water potential measurements were variable, as water potentials in seedlings grown in elevated CO2 were intermittently higher on some measurement days but lower on others than that of seedlings grown in the ambient atmosphere. These results suggest that elevated CO2 exerts stimulatory effects on shoot and root growth of juvenile ponderosa pine under field conditions which are somewhat dependent on N availability, but that temporal variation may periodically result in a greater response to a moderate rise in atmospheric CO2 than to a doubling of the current ambient concentration.},

An imperative exists, therefore, to elucidate the interactive effects of elevated Ca and drought on plant water relations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A spring wheat (cv. Yecora Rojo) crop was exposed to ambient (Control: 370 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) and free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE: ambient + 180 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) under ample (Wet), and reduced (Dry), water supplies (100 and 50\% replacement of evapotranspiration, respectively) over a 2-yr study. Our objective was to characterize and quantify the responses of 26 edaphic, gas exchange, water relations, carbohydrate pool dynamics, growth, and development parameters to rising Ca and drought. Increasing Ca minimized the deleterious effects of soil-water depletion by increasing drought avoidance (i.e., lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and growth and development of a more robust root system) and drought tolerance (i.e., enhanced osmoregulation and adaptation of tissue) mechanisms, resulting in a 30\% reduction in water stress-induced midafternoon depressions in net assimilation rate. An elevated C a-based increase in daily and seasonal carbon gain resulted in a positive feedback between source capacity (shoots) and sink demand (roots). Devoid of a concomitant rise in global temperature resulting from the rise in Ca, improved water relations for a herbaceous, cool-season, annual, C3 cereal monocot grass (i.e., wheat) are anticipated in a future high-CO2 world. These findings are applicable to other graminaceous species of a similar function-type as wheat common to temperate zone grassland prairies and savannas, especially under dryland conditions.},

This study was conducted to examine effects on soil respiration of the concurrent driving factors of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, air warming, and changing precipitation in a constructed old-field grassland in eastern Tennessee, USA. Model ecosystems of seven old-field species were established in open-top chambers and treated with factorial combinations of ambient or elevated (+300{$\quad$}ppm) CO2 concentration, ambient or elevated (+3{$\quad^\circ$}C) air temperature, and high or low soil moisture content. During the 19-month experimental period from June 2003 to December 2004, higher CO2 concentration and soil water availability significantly increased mean soil respiration by 35.8\% and 15.7\%, respectively. The effects of air warming on soil respiration varied seasonally from small reductions to significant increases to no response, and there was no significant main effect. In the wet side of elevated CO2 chambers, air warming consistently caused increases in soil respiration, whereas in the other three combinations of CO2 and water treatments, warming tended to decrease soil respiration over the growing season but increase it over the winter. There were no interactive effects on soil respiration among any two or three treatment factors irrespective of time period. Treatment-induced changes in soil temperature and moisture together explained 49\%, 44\%, and 56\% of the seasonal variations of soil respiration responses to elevated CO2, air warming, and changing precipitation, respectively. Additional indirect effects of seasonal dynamics and responses of plant growth on C substrate supply were indicated. Given the importance of indirect effects of the forcing factors and plant community dynamics on soil temperature, moisture, and C substrate, soil respiration response to climatic warming should not be represented in models as a simple temperature response function, and a more mechanistic representation including vegetation dynamics and substrate supply is needed.},

We compared root characteristics across five root orders in Pinus tabuliformis plantations treated for 3 years to a gradient of N addition (0-15 g m(-2) year(-1)). In reference plots, the roots of P. tabuliformis were finer and with higher specific root length than reported for other pine species, suggesting severe N limitation. Addition of N resulted in slightly reduced fine root biomass and significant changes in root morphology, responses that were associated primarily with first and second order roots. In particular, root number, cumulative root length, individual root length, and specific root length all declined with increasing N addition for first and second order roots, with most of the responses elicited at {$<$}9 g m(-2) year(-1) N addition. These responses (1) support the concept of ephemeral root modules consisting of first and second orders and (2) are consistent with a change in functional demand from uptake to transport with increasing soil resource availability. Traditionally, fine roots have been identified by a somewhat arbitrary diameter cut-off (e.g., 1 or 2 mm); as an index of fine root function, diameter would fail to reveal most of the functional response.},

(sweetgum) tree plantation exposed to long-term elevated (ECO2) or ambient (ACO2) CO2 treatments. Stem sap velocities were analyzed to assess plant response to potential interactions between CO2 and these weather extremes. Canopy conductance and net carbon assimilation (Anet) were modeled based on patterns of sap velocity to estimate indirect impacts of observed reductions in transpiration under ECO2 on premature leaf senescence. Elevated CO2 reduced sap flow by 28\% during early summer, and by up to 45\% late in the drought during record-setting temperatures. Modeled canopy conductance declined more rapidly in ECO2 plots during this period, thereby directly reducing carbon gain at a greater rate than in ACO2 plots. Indeed, pre-drought canopy Anet was similar across treatment plots, but declined to {$\sim$}40\% less than Anet in ACO2 as the drought progressed, likely leading to negative net carbon balance. Consequently, premature leaf senescence and abscission increased rapidly during this period, and was 30\% greater for ECO2. While ECO2 can reduce leaf-level water use under droughty conditions, acute drought may induce excessive stomatal closure that could offset benefits of ECO2 to temperate forest species during extreme weather events.},

However, there is evidence that A may decline through time due to biochemical and morphological acclimation, and environmental constraints. Indeed, at the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) study in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, A was increased in 12-year-old sweetgum trees following 2 years of {$\sim$}40 \% enhancement of CO2. A was re-assessed a decade later to determine if the initial enhancement of photosynthesis by eCO2 was sustained through time. Measurements were conducted at prevailing CO2 and temperature on detached, re-hydrated branches using a portable gas exchange system. Photosynthetic CO2 response curves (A versus the CO2 concentration in the intercellular air space (Ci); or A--Ci curves) were contrasted with earlier measurements using leaf photosynthesis model equations. Relationships between light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat), maximum electron transport rate (Jmax), maximum Rubisco activity (Vcmax), chlorophyll content and foliar nitrogen (N) were assessed. In 1999, Asat for eCO2 treatments was 15.4 {\textpm} 0.8 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1, 22 \% higher than aCO2 treatments (P \&lt; 0.01). By 2009, Asat declined to \&lt;50 \% of 1999 values, and there was no longer a significant effect of eCO2 (Asat = 6.9 or 5.7 {\textpm} 0.7 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1 for eCO2 or aCO2, respectively). In 1999, there was no treatment effect on area-based foliar N; however, by 2008, N content in eCO2 foliage was 17 \% less than that in aCO2 foliage. Photosynthetic N-use efficiency (Asat : N) was greater in eCO2 in 1999 resulting in greater Asat despite similar N content, but the enhanced efficiency in eCO2 trees was lost as foliar N declined to sub-optimal levels. There was no treatment difference in the declining linear relationships between Jmax or Vcmax with declining N, or in the ratio of Jmax : Vcmax through time. Results suggest that the initial enhancement of photosynthesis to elevated CO2 will not be sustained through time if N becomes limited.},

In a field free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, we determined, for four legume species, whether the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] on symbiotic N fixation depended on soil N availability or species identity. Natural abundance and pool-dilution 15N methods were used to estimate N fixation.

Rather, the effect of elevated [CO2] on N fixation was positive, neutral or negative, depending on the species and N addition.

To date, the mechanism(s) driving the nitrogen--albedo relationship have not been established, and it is unknown whether factors affecting nitrogen availability will also influence albedo. To address these questions, we examined variation in foliar nitrogen in relation to leaf spectral properties, leaf mass per unit area, and leaf water content for three deciduous species subjected to either nitrogen (Harvard Forest, MA, and Oak Ridge, TN) or CO2 fertilization (Oak Ridge, TN). At Oak Ridge, we also obtained canopy reflectance data from the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) to examine whether canopy-level spectral responses were consistent with leaf-level results. At the leaf level, results showed no differences in reflectance or transmittance between CO2 or nitrogen treatments, despite significant changes in foliar nitrogen. Contrary to our expectations, there was a significant, but negative, relationship between foliar nitrogen and leaf albedo, a relationship that held for both full spectrum leaf albedo as well as leaf albedo in the NIR region alone. In contrast, remote sensing data indicated an increase in canopy NIR reflectance with nitrogen fertilization. Collectively, these results suggest that altered nitrogen availability can affect canopy albedo, albeit by mechanisms that involve canopy-level processes rather than changes in leaf-level reflectance.},

  abstract = {How forests will respond to rising [CO2] in the long term is uncertain, most studies having involved juvenile trees in chambers prior to canopy closure. Poplar free-air CO2 enrichment (Viterbo, Italy) is one of the first experiments to grow a forest from planting through canopy closure to coppice, entirely under open-air conditions using free-air CO2 enrichment technology. Three Populus species: P. alba, P. nigra and P. x euramericana, were grown in three blocks, each containing one control and one treatment plot in which CO2 was elevated to the expected 2050 concentration of 550 ppm. The objective of this study was to estimate gross primary production (GPP) from recorded leaf photosynthetic properties, leaf area index (LAI) and meteorological conditions over the complete 3-year rotation cycle. From the meteorological conditions recorded at 30 min intervals and biweekly measurements of LAI, the microclimate of leaves within the plots was estimated with a radiation transfer and energy balance model. This information was in turn used as input into a canopy microclimate model to determine light and temperature of different leaf classes at 30 min intervals which in turn was used with the steady-state biochemical model of leaf photosynthesis to compute CO2 uptake by the different leaf classes. The parameters of these models were derived from measurements made at regular intervals throughout the coppice cycle. The photosynthetic rates for different leaf classes were summed to obtain canopy photosynthesis, i.e. GPP. The model was run for each species in each plot, so that differences in GPP between species and treatments could be tested statistically. Significant stimulation of GPP driven by elevated [CO2] occurred in all 3 years, and was greatest in the first year (223--251\%), but markedly lower in the second (19--24\%) and third years (5--19\%). Increase in GPP in elevated relative to control plots was highest for P. nigra in 1999 and for P. x euramericana in 2000 and 2001, although in 1999 P. alba had a higher GPP than P. x euramericana. Our analysis attributed the decline in stimulation to canopy closure and not photosynthetic acclimation. Over the 3-year rotation cycle from planting to harvest, the cumulative GPP was 4500, 4960 and 4010 g C m-2 for P. alba, P. nigra and P. x euramericana, respectively, in current [CO2] and 5260, 5800 and 5000 g C m-2 in the elevated [CO2] treatments. The relative changes were consistent with independent measurements of net primary production, determined independently from biomass increments and turnover.},

Our results revealed that the elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the seasonal cumulative CH4 emissions by 15~\% on average during the 4-year period. The increase was insignificant and much weaker than the previous studies, which might be primarily attributed to the absence of a significant difference in the rice biomass between the two CO2 levels in half of the field treatments. Crop residue incorporation hindered the stimulatory effects induced by the elevated CO2, which were 37, 14 and 6~\% for the fields that were incorporated with none, half or all of the wheat straws that were harvested in the preceding winter wheat season, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizers application also hindered the stimulatory effects of the elevated CO2 on the CH4 emissions. The CO2 stimulatory effect was 39~\% for the field without nitrogen fertilizers, and reduced to 17, 7 and 5~\% for the field with nitrogen fertilization of 125, 250 and 350~kg~N~ha-1, respectively. The regulation of nitrogen fertilizers on the CO2 effects in this experiment does not well agree with the previous studies, which might because the soil type was different from those of the previous studies. Thus, further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of soil properties in regulating the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on CH4 emissions from managed and natural wetlands. There were no significant interactions between the atmospheric CO2 and the incorporations of nitrogen fertilizer and crop residue. Appropriate experiments are necessary for better understanding of the interact influences of the elevated CO2 and farm managements.},

The elevated CO2 significantly stimulated methane emission, which was mainly due to the stimulation in rice growth. Intensifying N fertilization mitigated the CH4 emission under the ambient CO2 but stimulated the CH4 emission under the elevated CO2. This suggests that N fertilization has a potential to stimulate both CH4 production and CH4 oxidation. Thus the net effect of N fertilization on CH4 emission from paddy rice fields most likely depends upon the counterbalance between the nitrogen-induced increases in CH4 production and CH4 oxidation, as a N excess may result in the inhibition of methane emission, whereas a N limitation may result in the stimulation of methane emission.},

Elevated CO2 increased the allocation of biomass and carbon into roots and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) as well as the leaf soluble sugar content, but decreased the allocation of biomass and carbon into leaves, leaf nitrogen and leaf soluble protein concentrations. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased the partitioning of nitrogen into leaves, but increased that into roots, especially under soil drought. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased the carbon isotope discrimination ({$\Delta$}) in leaves, but increased them in roots, and the ratio of {$\Delta$} values between root and leaf, indicating an increased allocation into below-ground parts.

  abstract = {It is reported that stimulating effect of elevated atmospheric [CO2] on photosynthesis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is likely to be reduced during the plant growth period. However, there is little information on seasonal changes in dry matter (DM) production and distribution of rice under elevated atmospheric [CO2]. A free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment was conducted at Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, in 2001--2003, using Wuxiangging 14, a japonica cultivar. The rice was grown at ambient or elevated (ca. 200{$\mu$}molmol-1 above ambient) [CO2] and supplied with 25gNm2, which is the normal N application rate for local farmers. DM accumulation of rice in FACE plots was significantly increased by 40, 30, 22, 26 and 16\% on average at tillering, panicle initiation (PI), heading, mid-ripening and grain maturity, respectively. Rice DM production under FACE was significantly enhanced by 41, 27, 15 and 38\% on average during the growth periods from transplanting to tillering (Period 1), tillering to PI (Period 2), PI to heading (Period 3) and heading to mid-ripening (Period 4), respectively, but significantly decreased by 25\% in the period from mid-ripening to grain maturity (Period 5). In general, seasonal changes in crop response to FACE in both green leaf area index (GLAI) and net assimilation rate (NAR) followed a similar pattern to that of the DM production. Under FACE the leaves decreased significantly in proportion to the total above-ground DM over the season, the stems showed an opposite trend, while the spikes depended on crop development stage: showing no change at heading, significant increase (+4\%) at mid-ripening and significant decrease (-3\%) at grain maturity. Grain yield was stimulated by an average of 13\% by FACE, due to increased total DM production rather than any changes in partitioning to the grain. We conclude that the gradual acclimation of rice growth to elevated [CO2] do not occur inevitably, and it could also be altered by environmental conditions (e.g., cultivation technique).},

  abstract = {Hybrid rice cultivar plays an important role in rice production system due to its high yield potential and resistance to environmental stress. Quantification of its responses to rising CO2 concentration ([CO2]) will reduce our uncertainty in predicting future food security and assist in development of adaptation strategies. Using free air CO2 enrichment (FACE), we measured seasonal changes in growth and nitrogen (N) uptake of an inter-subspecific hybrid rice cultivar Liangyoupeijiu grown under two levels of [CO2] (ambient and elevated by 200{$\mu$}molmol-1) and two levels of N fertilization in 2005--2006. Average across the 2 years, FACE increased crop growth rate similarly by 22\%, 24\% and 23\% in the periods from transplanting to panicle initiation (PI), PI to heading and heading to maturity, which was mainly attributed to an increase in green leaf area index rather than the greater net assimilation rate. Grain yield increased greatly under FACE as a result of similar contributions by panicle number per unit area, grain number per panicle and individual grain yield. Final aboveground N acquisition showed a 10.4\% increase under FACE, which resulted from enhanced N uptake at both vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Compared with previous FACE studies on final productivity of two inbred japonica cultivars, inter-subspecific hybrid cultivar appears to profit more from elevated [CO2], which mainly resulted from its greater enhancement in photosynthetic production during reproductive growth due to a lack of N limitations late in the season.},

Our model is based on the observation that in nutrient-poor soils, plants (C3) grown in an elevated CO2 atmosphere often increase production and allocation to belowground structures. We predicted that greater belowground C inputs at elevated CO2 should elicit an increase in soil microbial biomass and increased rates of organic matter turnover and nitrogen availability. We measured photosynthesis, biomass production, and C allocation of Populus grandidentata Michx. grown in nutrient-poor soil for one field season at ambient and twice-ambient (i.e., elevated) atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Plants were grown in a sandy subsurface soil i) at ambient CO2 with no open top chamber, ii) at ambient CO2 in an open top chamber, and iii) at twice-ambient CO2 in an open top chamber. Plants were fertilized with 4.5 g N m-2 over a 47 d period midway through the growing season. Following 152 d of growth, we quantified microbial biomass and the availabilities of C and N in rhizosphere and bulk soil. We tested for a significant CO2 effect on plant growth and soil C and N dynamics by comparing the means of the chambered ambient and chambered elevated CO2 treatments.},

  abstract = {Our ability to predict whether elevated atmospheric CO2 will alter the cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems requires understanding a complex set of feedback mechanisms initiated by changes in C and N acquisition by plants and the degree to which changes in resource acquisition (C and N) alter plant growth and allocation. To gain further insight into these dynamics, we grew six genotypes of Populus tremuloides Michx. that differ in autumnal senescence (early vs. late) under experimental atmospheric CO2 (35.7 and 70.7 Pa) and soil-N availability (low and high) treatments. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were manipulated with open-top chambers, and soil-N availability was modified in open-bottom root boxes by mixing different proportions of native A and C horizon soil. Net N mineralization rates averaged 61 ng N{$\cdot$}g-1{$\cdot$}d-1 in low-N soil and 319 ng N{$\cdot$}g-1{$\cdot$}d-1 in high-N soil. After 2.5 growing seasons, we harvested above- and belowground plant components in each chamber and determined total biomass, N concentration, N content, and the relative allocation of biomass and N to leaves, stems, and roots.    Elevated CO2 increased total plant biomass 16\% in low-N soil and 38\% in high-N soil, indicating that the growth response of P. tremuloides to elevated CO2 was constrained by soil-N availability. Greater growth under elevated CO2 did not substantially alter the allocation of biomass to above- or belowground plant components. At both levels of soil-N availability, elevated CO2 decreased the N concentration of all plant tissues. Despite declines in tissue N concentration, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant N content in high-N soil (ambient = 137 g N/chamber; elevated = 155 g N/chamber), but it did not influence whole-plant N content in low-N soil (36 g N/chamber). Our results indicate that plants in high-N soil obtained greater amounts of soil N under elevated CO2 by producing a proportionately larger fine-root system that more thoroughly exploited the soil. The significant positive relationship between fine-root biomass and total-plant N content we observed in high-N soil further supports this contention. In low-N soil, elevated CO2 did not increase fine-root biomass or production, and plants under ambient and elevated CO2 obtained equivalent amounts of N from soil. In high-N soil, it appears that greater acquisition of soil N under elevated CO2 fed forward within the plant to increase rates of C acquisition, which further enhanced plant growth response to elevated CO2.},

  abstract = {As human activity continues to increase CO2 and O3, broad expanses of north temperate forests will be simultaneously exposed to elevated concentrations of these trace gases. Although both CO2 and O3 are potent modifiers of plant growth, we do not understand the extent to which they alter competition for limiting soil nutrients, like nitrogen (N). We quantified the acquisition of soil N in two 8-year-old communities composed of trembling aspen genotypes (n= 5) and trembling aspen--paper birch which were exposed to factorial combinations of CO2 (ambient and 560 {$\mu$}L L-1) and O3 (ambient = 30--40 vs. 50--60 nL L-1). Tracer amount of 15NH4+ were applied to soil to determine how these trace gases altered the competitive ability of genotypes and species to acquire soil N. One year after isotope addition, we assessed N acquisition by measuring the amount of 15N tracer contained in the plant canopy (i.e. recent N acquisition), as well as the total amount of canopy N (i.e. cumulative N acquisition). Exposure to elevated CO2 differentially altered recent and cumulative N acquisition among aspen genotypes, changing the rank order in which they obtained soil N. Elevated O3 also altered the rank order in which aspen genotypes obtained soil N by eliciting increases, decreases and no response among genotypes. If aspen genotypes respond similarly under field conditions, then rising concentrations of CO2 and O3 could alter the structure of aspen populations. In the aspen--birch community, elevated CO2 increased recent N (i.e. 15N) acquisition in birch (68\%) to a greater extent than aspen (19\%), suggesting that, over the course of this experiment, birch had gained a competitive advantage over aspen. The response of genotypes and species to rising CO2 and O3 concentrations, and how these responses are modified by competitive interactions, has the potential to change the future composition and productivity of northern temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic O3 and CO2-induced declines in soil N availability could counteract greater plant growth in a CO2-enriched atmosphere, thereby reducing net primary productivity (NPP) and the potential of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester anthropogenic CO2. Presently, it is uncertain how increasing atmospheric CO2 and O3 will alter plant N demand and the acquisition of soil N by plants as well as the microbial supply of N from soil organic matter. To address this uncertainty, we initiated an ecosystem-level 15N tracer experiment at the Rhinelander (Wisconsin, USA) free air CO2-O3 enrichment (FACE) facility to understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and 03 alter the distribution and flow of N in developing northern temperate forests. Tracer amounts of 15NH4+ were applied to the forest floor of developing Populus tremuloides and P. tremuloides-Betula papyrifera communities that have been exposed to factorial CO2 and O3 treatments for seven years. One year after isotope addition, both forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 obtained greater amounts of 15N (29\%) and N (40\%) from soil, despite no change in soil N availability or plant N-use efficiency. As such, elevated CO2 increased the ability of plants to exploit soil for N, through the development of a larger root system. Conversely, elevated O3 decreased the amount of 15N (-15\%) and N (-29\%) in both communities, a response resulting from lower rates of photosynthesis, decreases in growth, and smaller root systems that acquired less soil N. Neither CO2 nor 03 altered the amount of N or 15N recovery in the forest floor, microbial biomass, or soil organic matter. Moreover, we observed no interaction between CO2 and 03 on the amount of N or 15N in any ecosystem pool, suggesting that 03 could exert a negative effect regardless of CO2 concentration. In a CO2-enriched atmosphere, greater belowground growth and a more thorough exploitation of soil for growth-limiting N is an important mechanism sustaining the enhancement of NPP in developing forests (0-8 years following establishment). However, as CO2 accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, future O3 concentrations threaten to diminish the enhancement of plant growth, decrease plant N acquisition, and lessen the storage of anthropogenic C in temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Global climate and atmospheric changes may interact in their effects on the diversity and composition of natural communities. We followed responses of an annual grassland to three years of all possible combinations of experimentally elevated CO               2               (+300 {\textmu}L/L), warming (+80 W/m               2               , +{$\sim$}1{$^\circ$}C), nitrogen deposition (+7 g N{$\cdot$}m               --2               {$\cdot$}yr               --1               ), and precipitation (+50\%). Responses of the 10 most common plant species to global changes and to interannual variability were weak but sufficiently consistent within functional groups to drive clearer responses at the functional group level. The dominant functional groups (annual grasses and forbs) showed distinct production and abundance responses to individual global changes. After three years, N deposition suppressed plant diversity, forb production, and forb abundance in association with enhanced grass production. Elevated precipitation enhanced plant diversity, forb production, and forb abundance but affected grasses little. Warming increased forb production and abundance but did not strongly affect diversity or grass response. Elevated CO               2               reduced diversity with little effect on relative abundance or production of forbs and grasses. Realistic combinations of global changes had small diversity effects but more marked effects on the relative dominance of forbs and grasses. The largest change in relative functional group abundance (+50\% forbs) occurred under the combination of elevated CO               2               + warming + precipitation, which will likely affect much of California in the future. Strong interannual variability in diversity, individual species abundances, and functional group abundances indicated that in our system, (1) responses after three years were not constrained by lags in community response, (2) individual species were more sensitive to interannual variability and extremes than to mean changes in environmental and resource conditions, and (3) simulated global changes interacted with interannual variability to produce responses of varying magnitude and even direction among years. Relative abundance of forbs, the most speciose group in the community, ranged after three years from {$>$}30\% under elevated CO               2               + warming + precipitation to {$<$}12\% under N deposition. While opposing production responses at the ecosystem level by different functional groups may buffer responses such as net primary production (NPP) change, these shifts in relative dominance could influence ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and NPP via differences between grasses and forbs in tissue chemistry, allocation, phenology, and productivity.

The exploration on bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution constitutes a key solution, where rational design strategies to integrate various active sites into a high-performance air cathode remain insufficient. Herein, a multiscale construction strategy is proposed to rationally direct the fabrication of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for long-lifespan rechargeable zinc--air batteries. NiFe layered double hydroxides and cobalt coordinated framework porphyrin are selected as the active sites considering their high intrinsic activity at the molecular level, and the active sites are successively integrated on three-dimensional conductive scaffolds at mesoscale to strengthen ion transportation. Consequently, the multiscale constructed electrocatalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional performance ({$\Delta$}E = 0.68 V), which is even better than that of the noble metal based benchmarks. The corresponding air cathodes endow zinc--air batteries with a reduced voltage gap of 0.74 V, a high power density of 185.0 mW cm-2, and an ultralong lifespan of more than 2400 cycles at 5.0 mA cm-2. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy to rationally integrate various active sites to construct multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-related processes.},

By the time of glyphosate application, approximately 2 mo after emergence, elevated CO{$_2$} had resulted in significant increases in both root and shoot biomass. However, the relative positive effect of [CO{$_2$}] was much larger for root, relative to shoot growth, during this period (2.5- to 3.3-fold vs. 1.2- to 1.4- fold, respectively) with a subsequent increase in root to shoot ratio. Glyphosate was applied at 2.24 kg ae ha{$^{-1}$} in 2000 and 2003. Subjective classification of leaf damage in shoots after spraying indicated no significant difference in the extent of necrosis in aboveground tissue as a function of CO{$_2$} concentration. After a 6-wk regrowth period, significant reductions in shoot and root biomass relative to unsprayed plots were observed under ambient [CO{$_2$}]. However, the decrease in the ratio of sprayed to unsprayed biomass was significantly less at elevated relative to ambient [CO{$_2$}] conditions for roots in both years, and no difference in shoot biomass was observed between sprayed and unsprayed plots for Canada thistle grown at elevated [CO{$_2$}] in either year. The observed reduction in glyphosate efficacy at the enriched [CO{$_2$}] treatment did not appear to be associated with differential herbicide uptake, suggesting that tolerance was simply a dilution effect, related to the large stimulation of root relative to shoot biomass at elevated [CO{$_2$}]. Overall, the study indicates that carbon dioxide-induced increases in root biomass could make Canada thistle and other perennial weeds that reproduce asexually from belowground organs harder to control in a higher [CO{$_2$}] world.},

In particular, we find that tropospheric ozone is projected to decrease (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6) or increase (RCP8.5) between 2000 and 2100, with variations in methane a strong contributor to this spread. The associated tropospheric ozone global radiative forcing is shown to be in agreement with the estimate used in the RCPs, except for RCP8.5. Surface ozone in 2100 is projected to change little compared from its 2000 distribution, a much-reduced impact from previous projections based on the A2 high-emission scenario. In addition, globally-averaged stratospheric ozone is projected to recover at or beyond pre-1980 levels. Anthropogenic aerosols are projected to strongly decrease in the 21st century, a reflection of their projected decrease in emissions. Consequently, sulfate deposition is projected to strongly decrease. However, nitrogen deposition is projected to increase over certain regions because of the projected increase in NH3 emissions.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial biosphere plays a major role in the global carbon cycle, and there is a recognized need for regularly updated estimates of land-atmosphere exchange at regional and global scales. An international ensemble of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), known as the “Trends and drivers of the regional scale terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon dioxide” (TRENDY) project, quantifies land biophysical exchange processes and biogeochemistry cycles in support of the annual Global Carbon Budget assessments and the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes, phase 2 project. DGVMs use a common protocol and set of driving data sets. A set of factorial simulations allows attribution of spatio-temporal changes in land surface processes to three primary global change drivers: changes in atmospheric CO2, climate change and variability, and Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC). Here, we describe the TRENDY project, benchmark DGVM performance using remote-sensing and other observational data, and present results for the contemporary period. Simulation results show a large global carbon sink in natural vegetation over 2012–2021, attributed to the CO2 fertilization effect (3.8 ± 0.8 PgC/yr) and climate (−0.58 ± 0.54 PgC/yr). Forests and semi-arid ecosystems contribute approximately equally to the mean and trend in the natural land sink, and semi-arid ecosystems continue to dominate interannual variability. The natural sink is offset by net emissions from LULCC (−1.6 ± 0.5 PgC/yr), with a net land sink of 1.7 ± 0.6 PgC/yr. Despite the largest gross fluxes being in the tropics, the largest net land-atmosphere exchange is simulated in the extratropical regions.},

	abstract = {Soils play a key role in providing a range of ecosystem services. Quality-assessed soil information, with quantified uncertainty levels, is needed to address a range of global issues. Traditional mapping methods, which recognize that soil classes are “important carriers of soil information”, were used to prepare an updated harmonized dataset of derived soil properties for the world at a nominal resolution of 30 by 30arc sec (WISE30sec). The map unit composition was determined using an overlay of the Harmonized World Soil Database, with minor corrections, and the Köppen–Geiger climate zones map as categorical co-variate. Property estimates for the respective component soil units were derived using taxonomy-based transfer rules that draw on a statistical analysis of some 21,000 soil profiles. Best estimates (mean±standard deviation) for twenty soil properties were calculated for seven depth intervals (up to 2m depth or less when thinner): organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH(H2O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, total exchangeable bases (TEB), base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (content of sand, silt and clay), proportion of coarse fragments ({\textgreater}2mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (−33 to −1500kPa); also the dominant soil drainage class. Coefficients of variation tend to be large. WISE30sec may be used for applications at a broad scale ({\textless}1:1M) upon consideration of the underlying data lineage, generalizations, and the associated uncertainties. As an example, the database was used to calculate the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock to 2m depth. Some 30\% (607±87PgC) of this stock (2060±215PgC) is held in the Northern Circumpolar Region, which is considered most sensitive to climate change.},

It is designed to make the more numerical aspects of the subject accessible to plant and environmental science students, and will also provide a valuable reference source to practitioners and researchers in the field. The third edition of this widely recognised text has been completely revised and updated to take account of key developments in the field. Approximately half of the references are new to this edition and relevant online resources are also incorporated for the first time. The recent proliferation of molecular and genetic research on plants is related to whole plant responses, showing how these new approaches can advance our understanding of the biophysical interactions between plants and the atmosphere. Remote sensing technologies and their applications in the study of plant function are also covered in greater detail.},

	abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the results of 2000–2100 simulations following the emissions associated with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with a chemistry-climate model, focusing on the changes in 1) atmospheric composition (troposphere and stratosphere) and 2) associated environmental parameters (such as nitrogen deposition). In particular, we find that tropospheric ozone is projected to decrease (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6) or increase (RCP8.5) between 2000 and 2100, with variations in methane a strong contributor to this spread. The associated tropospheric ozone global radiative forcing is shown to be in agreement with the estimate used in the RCPs, except for RCP8.5. Surface ozone in 2100 is projected to change little compared from its 2000 distribution, a much-reduced impact from previous projections based on the A2 high-emission scenario. In addition, globally-averaged stratospheric ozone is projected to recover at or beyond pre-1980 levels. Anthropogenic aerosols are projected to strongly decrease in the 21st century, a reflection of their projected decrease in emissions. Consequently, sulfate deposition is projected to strongly decrease. However, nitrogen deposition is projected to increase over certain regions because of the projected increase in NH3 emissions.},
